## Context
The Automate deployment service can be used to deploy a standalone chef server without
Automate. We consider this feature in its current state suitable for customer use as a
services option. We have discussed the work to make deploying a single chef server via the
Automate deployment service a full DIY product feature, but as of yet, we do not have
concrete plans or schedule. Deploying HA chef server via the Automate deployment service
is intended as a services option only.

As of July 2019, the audience for the chef server deployed via the Automate deployment service consists
of:

1. opsworks, which deploys an all-in-one Automate with chef server on a single node
2. the Customer Success team, which in July 2019 will start using the deployment service to deploy HA
   chef server at selected customer sites,
3. the Professional Services team, which is planning to start using the deployment service
   to deploy HA chef server some time around August 2019.

This document was written with the latter two groups in mind.

## Deploy a new standalone chef server via Automate
1. Install the chef-automate CLI tool.
2. Run `chef-automate init-config` to generate an editable config.toml.
3. Under the `[deployment.v1.svc]` section in the config.toml, add `products = ["chef-server"]`:
```
   [deployment.v1.svc]
   products = ["chef-server"]
```
4. Add to the config.toml:
```
   [erchef.v1.sys.data_collector]
   enabled = false
```
Make any other config changes necessary.
5. Run `chef-automate deploy config.toml` to install the chef
   server. When the chef server comes up, the running services are:
```
   $ sudo ./chef-automate status

```

## Forward data from the Automate-deployed chef server to Automate
1. Make sure you have the data collector token from your Automate instance handy.
2. On the node where you have deployed the chef server, create a chef_server_patch.toml file that contains
```
   [global.v1.external.automate]
   enable = true
   node = "<https://automate.example.com>"
   [global.v1.external.automate.auth]
   token = "<yourdatacollectortoken>"

   [erchef.v1.sys.data_collector]
   enabled = true
   ```
3. Patch your chef server deployment: `chef-automate config patch chef_server_patch.toml`

## Deploy HA chef server via the Automate deployment-service
HA for the Automate-deployed chef server involves externally load-balanced chef servers sharing external
elasticsearch and postgres. As such, it is a services option and not intended as a DIY
option for customers.

### Deploy a chef server with external data services via the Automate deployment service
1. Install the chef-automate CLI tool.
2. Run `chef-automate init-config` to generate an editable config.toml.
3. Under the `[deployment.v1.svc]` section in the config.toml, add `products = ["chef-server"]`:
```
   [deployment.v1.svc]
   products = ["chef-server"]
```
4. Add the following to the config.toml from 2:
```
   [erchef.v1.sys.data_collector]
   enabled = false
```
5. Configure external elasticsearch by adding the following to the config.toml:
```
   [global.v1.external.elasticsearch]
   enable = true
   nodes = ["http://server1:9200", "http://server2:9200"]     # can be either http or https, but not a mixture

   # Uncomment and fill out if using elasticsearch with basic auth
   # [global.v1.external.elasticsearch.auth]
   # scheme = "basic_auth"
   # [global.v1.external.elasticsearch.auth.basic_auth]
   # username = "<username>"
   # password = "<password>"
   # [global.v1.external.elasticsearch.ssl]
   # root_cert_file = "</path/to/cert/file>"
   # server_name = "<elasticsearch server name>"
```
6. Configure external postgres by adding the following to the config.toml:
```
  [global.v1.external.postgresql]
  enable = true
  nodes = ["127.0.0.1:5555"]

  [global.v1.external.postgresql.auth]
  enable = true
  scheme = "password"

  [global.v1.external.postgresql.auth.password.superuser]
  username = "<pg superuser username>"
  password = "<pg superuser password>"
  [global.v1.external.postgresql.auth.password.dbuser]
  username = "<dbuser username>"
  password = "<dbuser password>"

  [global.v1.external.postgresql.backup]
  enable = true

  # Uncomment and fill out this section if using postgres with ssl
  # [global.v1.external.postgresql.ssl]
  # enable = true
  # root_cert = "</path/to/rootCA.pem>"
```
7. Make any other config changes necessary.
8. Run `chef-automate deploy config.toml` to install the chef
   server.

### Create a bootstrap bundle (.abb)
The bootstrap bundle contains chef server keys needed to start the second chef server.

On your original chef server node, run
   `chef-automate bootstrap bundle create </path/to/bundle.abb>`
to create a bundle containing the necessary keys, etc., to deploy a second chef server.

### Deploy a second chef server on another node
1. Copy the bootstrap bundle to the node where you wish to deploy the second chef server.
2. Run `chef-automate init-config` to generate a config.toml.
   a. Under the `[deployment.v1.svc]` section, add `products = ["chef-server"]`:
```
      [deployment.v1.svc]
      products = ["chef-server"]
```
   b. Edit the config.toml to add the data collector configuration:
```
   [erchef.v1.sys.data_collector]
   enabled = false
```
   c. Edit the config.toml to use the same external elasticsearch and postgres
   configuration as the first chef server.
3. Run `chef-automate deploy --bootstrap-bundle /path/to/bundle.abb
   config.toml` to deploy the second chef server.
4. On both chef servers, patch the config as described previously to forward data from the chef servers to
   Automate.
5. Set up external load balancing to direct traffic to both chef servers.
