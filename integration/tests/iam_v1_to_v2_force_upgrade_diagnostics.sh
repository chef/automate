# this test script:
# 1. deploys an older version of Automate on IAM v1
# 2. runs diagnostics without cleaning up the data. all v2 diagnostics are skipped 
#    because the system is on v1.
# 3. upgrades Automate to the latest build. This force-upgrades the system to IAM v2.
# 4. runs diagnostics, verify and cleanup steps only. 
#    since projects and roles were not generated, it skips those two. 
#    the v2 policies diagnostic verifies the v1 policy that was migrated to v2. 
#    the v1 policy diagnostic is skipped because the system is on v2.
