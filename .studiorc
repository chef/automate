getting_started << GETTING_STARTED

Welcome to the Habitat-based development environment for the Automate mono-repo!

===== Deploy Automate =====

    To get started, use this to start the deployment service, download the latest 'dev' images for
    each service, and spin up Automate. (when you don't need local UI development)

        # start_all_services

    If you need to develop against the UI.

        # build components/automate-ui-devproxy/
        # start_automate_ui_background
        # start_all_services

    See ./dev-docs/ui-development.md for additional information.

===== Rebuild Components and Hot-load the Results =====

    After Automate is running, you can rebuild an entire component's hab package from source,
    then HOT LOAD IT INTO YOUR DEPLOY, replacing the dev image that was there previously.
    (Use 'build' instead of 'rebuild' if you want to check dependencies also.)

        # rebuild components/<COMPONENT>

===== Rebuild just the Go Binary =====

    If you have Go changes but no hab package changes, you can rebuild just the Go binary for your component.
    This works for both hab packages you've already built AND packages initially downloaded from the chef depot.
    This is slightly faster than 'rebuild' described above, but 'hab sup status' will not show a local origin
    like 'rebuild' does (so you won't be able to tell at a glance which components you have built locally).

        # go_update_component COMPONENT_NAME

===== Helpful Commands =====

    Get a fully-permissioned token with 'get_admin_token'. It's also idempotent,
    so you'll get the same token every time after the first run and can do things like:

        # curl --insecure -H "api-token \$(get_admin_token)" https://localhost/api/v0/version

    Load various data sets with 'chef_load_actions' or 'chef_load_nodes'.

For a complete walkthrough of the dev environment, see ./README.md and ./dev-docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md.
Also try 'describe' at the hab studio prompt for a summary of available commands.

document "start_all_services" <<DOC
  Simple wrapper for 'start_deployment_service' and 'chef-automate dev deployinate'.
  Also applies a license (if present), creates IAM v2 dev users, and upgrades IAM to v2.
DOC

  start_deployment_service

  This will idempotently generate an API token that has universal access for all your dev / curl needs.

      # attempt iam v2 cmd
      chef-automate iam token create "api-token-$$" --admin >/tmp/admin_token || return 1
