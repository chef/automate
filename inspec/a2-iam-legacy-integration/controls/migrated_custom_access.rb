# This test suite must ONLY run on iam_v1_to_v2_force_upgrade.sh.
# That test scenario tests a specific case that upgrades an old version of 
# Automate using IAM v1 to the latest Automate, which force-upgrades it to IAM v2
# The test a2-iam-v1-integration/controls/custom_access_to_migrate.rb adds a custom policy to that older version.
# In this test we verify that the policy migrated correctly as part of the force-upgrade.
