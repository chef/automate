# Extras


Several files are included in the Citrus repository that make it easier to work
with grammar files in various editors.

## TextMate

To install the Citrus [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) bundle, simply
double-click on the `Citrus.tmbundle` file in the `extras` directory.

## Vim

To install the [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) scripts, copy the files in
`extras/vim` to a directory in Vim's
[runtimepath](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#\'runtimepath\').
