    # === Arguments:
    # Takes a single command, or a list of command fragments. These are used
    # as arguments to Kernel.exec. See the Kernel.exec documentation for more
    # explanation of how arguments are evaluated. The last argument can be an
    # options Hash.
    # === Options:
    # If the last argument is a Hash, it is removed from the list of args passed
    # to exec and used as an options hash. The following options are available:
    # * +user+: the user the command should run as. if an integer is given, it is
    #   used as a uid. A string is treated as a username and resolved to a uid
    #   with Etc.getpwnam
    # * +group+: the group the command should run as. works similarly to +user+
    # * +cwd+: the directory to chdir to before running the command
    # * +umask+: a umask to set before running the command. If given as an Integer,
    #   be sure to use two leading zeros so it's parsed as Octal. A string will
    #   be treated as an octal integer
    # * +returns+:  one or more Integer values to use as valid exit codes for the
    #   subprocess. This only has an effect if you call +error!+ after
    #   +run_command+.
    # * +environment+: a Hash of environment variables to set before the command
    #   is run.
    # * +timeout+: a Numeric value for the number of seconds to wait on the
    #   child process before raising an Exception. This is calculated as the
    #   total amount of time that ShellOut waited on the child process without
    #   receiving any output (i.e., IO.select returned nil). Default is 600
    #   seconds. Note: the stdlib Timeout library is not used.
    # * +input+: A String of data to be passed to the subcommand. This is
    #   written to the child process' stdin stream before the process is
    #   launched. The child's stdin stream will be a pipe, so the size of input
    #   data should not exceed the system's default pipe capacity (4096 bytes
    #   is a safe value, though on newer Linux systems the capacity is 64k by
    #   default).
    # * +live_stream+: An IO or Logger-like object (must respond to the append
    #   operator +<<+) that will receive data as ShellOut reads it from the
    #   child process. Generally this is used to copy data from the child to
    #   the parent's stdout so that users may observe the progress of
    #   long-running commands.
    # * +login+: Whether to simulate a login (set secondary groups, primary group, environment
    #   variables etc) as done by the OS in an actual login
    # === Examples:
    # Invoke find(1) to search for .rb files:
    #   find = Mixlib::ShellOut.new("find . -name '*.rb'")
    #   find.run_command
    #   # If all went well, the results are on +stdout+
    #   puts find.stdout
    #   # find(1) prints diagnostic info to STDERR:
    #   puts "error messages" + find.stderr
    #   # Raise an exception if it didn't exit with 0
    #   find.error!
    # Run a command as the +www+ user with no extra ENV settings from +/tmp+
    #   cmd = Mixlib::ShellOut.new("apachectl", "start", :user => 'www', :env => nil, :cwd => '/tmp')
    #   cmd.run_command # etc.
