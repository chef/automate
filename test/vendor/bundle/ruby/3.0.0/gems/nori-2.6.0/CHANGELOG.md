# 2.6.0 (2015-05-06)

* Feature: [#69](https://github.com/savonrb/nori/pull/69) Add option to convert empty tags to a value other than nil.

# 2.5.0 (2015-03-31)

* Formally drop support for ruby 1.8.7. Installing Nori from rubygems for that version should no longer attempt to install versions that will not work.

# 2.4.0 (2014-04-19)

* Change: Dropped support for ruby 1.8, rubinius and ree

* Feature: Added `:convert_attributes` feature similar to `:convert_tags_to`

* Feature: Added `:convert_dashes_to_underscore` option

# 2.3.0 (2013-07-26)

* Change: `Nori#find` now ignores namespace prefixes in Hash keys it is searching through.

* Fix: Limited Nokogiri to < 1.6, because v1.6 dropped support for Ruby 1.8.

# 2.2.0 (2013-04-25)

* Feature: [#42](https://github.com/savonrb/nori/pull/42) adds the `:delete_namespace_attributes`
  option to remove namespace attributes like `xmlns:*` or `xsi:*`.

# 2.1.0 (2013-04-21)

* Feature: Added `Nori.hash_key` and `Nori#find` to work with Hash keys generated by Nori.
  Original issue: [savonrb/savon#393](https://github.com/savonrb/savon/pull/393)

# 2.0.4 (2013-02-26)

  problem on Ruby 1.9.3-p392.

# 2.0.3 (2013-01-10)

* Fix for remote code execution bug. For more in-depth information, read about the
  recent [Rails hotfix](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/rubyonrails-security/61bkgvnSGTQ).
  Please make sure to upgrade now!

# 2.0.2 (YANKED)

* Yanked because of a problem with XML that starts with an instruction tag.

# 2.0.1 (YANKED)

* Yanked because of a problem with XML that starts with an instruction tag.

# 2.0.0 (2012-12-12)

Please make sure to read the updated README for how to use the new version.

* Change: Nori now defaults to use the Nokogiri parser.

* Refactoring: Changed the `Nori` module to a class. This might cause problems if you
  included the `Nori` module somewhere in your application. This use case was removed
  for overall simplicity.

* Refactoring: Changed the interface to remove any global state. The global configuration
  is gone and replaced with simple options to be passed to `Nori.new`.

    ``` ruby
    parser = Nori.new(strip_namespaces: true)
    parser.parse(xml)
    ```

* Refactoring: Removed the `Nori::Parser` module methods. After refactoring the rest,
  there was only a single method left for this module and that was moved to `Nori`.

* Fix: [#16](https://github.com/savonrb/nori/issues/16) strip XML passed to Nori.

## 1.1.5 (2013-03-03)

* Fix: [#37](https://github.com/savonrb/nori/issues/37) special characters
  problem on Ruby 1.9.3-p392.

## 1.1.4 (2013-01-10)

* Fix for remote code execution bug. For more in-depth information, read about the
  recent [Rails hotfix](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/rubyonrails-security/61bkgvnSGTQ).
  Please make sure to upgrade now!

## 1.1.3 (2012-07-12)

* Fix: Merged [pull request 21](https://github.com/savonrb/nori/pull/21) to fix an
  issue with date/time/datetime regexes not matching positive time zone offsets and
  datetime strings with seconds.

## 1.1.2 (2012-06-30)

* Fix: Reverted `Object#xml_attributes` feature which is planned for version 2.0.

## 1.1.1 (2012-06-29) - yanked

* Fix: Merged [pull request 17](https://github.com/savonrb/nori/pull/17) for improved
  xs:time/xs:date/xs:dateTime regular expression matchers.

## 1.1.0 (2012-02-17)

* Improvement: Merged [pull request 9](https://github.com/savonrb/nori/pull/9) to
  allow multiple configurations of Nori.

* Fix: Merged [pull request 10](https://github.com/savonrb/nori/pull/10) to handle
  date/time parsing errors. Fixes a couple of similar error reports.

## 1.0.2 (2011-07-04)

* Fix: When specifying a custom formula to convert tags, XML attributes were ignored.
  Now, a formula is applied to both XML tags and attributes.

## 1.0.1 (2011-06-21)

* Fix: Make sure to always load both StringWithAttributes and StringIOFile
  to prevent NameError's.

## 1.0.0 (2011-06-20)

* Notice: As of v1.0.0, Nori will follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).

* Feature: Added somewhat advanced typecasting:

  What this means:

  * "true" and "false" are converted to TrueClass and FalseClass
  * Strings matching an xs:time, xs:date and xs:dateTime are converted
    to Time, Date and DateTime objects.

  You can disable this feature via:

      Nori.advanced_typecasting = false

* Feature: Added an option to strip the namespaces from every tag.
  This feature might raise problems and is therefore disabled by default.

      Nori.strip_namespaces = true

* Feature: Added an option to specify a custom formula to convert tags.
  Here's an example:

      Nori.configure do |config|
        config.convert_tags_to { |tag| tag.snake_case.to_sym }
      end

      xml = '<userResponse><accountStatus>active</accountStatus></userResponse>'
      parse(xml).should ## { :user_response => { :account_status => "active" }

## 0.2.4 (2011-06-21)

* Fix: backported fixes from v1.0.1

## 0.2.3 (2011-05-26)

* Fix: Use extended core classes StringWithAttributes and StringIOFile instead of
  creating singletons to prevent serialization problems.

## 0.2.2 (2011-05-16)

* Fix: namespaced xs:nil values should be nil objects.

## 0.2.1 (2011-05-15)

* Fix: Changed XML attributes converted to Hash keys to be prefixed with an @-sign.
  This avoids problems with attributes and child nodes having the same name.

      <multiRef id="id1">
        <approved xsi:type="xsd:boolean">true</approved>
        <id xsi:type="xsd:long">76737</id>
      </multiRef>

  is now translated to:

      { "multiRef" => { "@id" => "id1", "id" => "76737", "approved" => "true" } }

## 0.2.0 (2011-04-30)

* Removed JSON from the original Crack basis
* Fixed a problem with Object#blank?
* Added swappable parsers
* Added a Nokogiri parser with you can switch to via:

      Nori.parser = :nokogiri

* 2 minor patches
  * Correct unnormalization of attribute values (der-flo)
