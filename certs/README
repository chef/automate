   - Put your Intermediate CA into the pem file.

   **If your organization issues from an Intermediate CA, chain the Intermediat cert(s) _after_ the Server cert file. And put it 
   For example, in certs/pg_ssl_public.pem paste them like so:     
     Server Certificate
     Intermediate CA Certificate 1
     Intermediate CA Certificate n
