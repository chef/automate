# *** WARNING ***
# Currently, the Habitat `init` and `health_check` hooks run directly from the main loop
# of the Habitat supervisor. If these hooks hang or take too long to run, they can block
# execution of the supervisor.
#
# Please put potentially long-running and/or complex operations in the run hook rather
# than the init hook until the issue[0] has been resolved.
