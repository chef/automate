# *** WARNING ***
# Please put potentially long-running and/or complex operations in the init hook rather
# than the run hook until the issue described in
#
# https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/issues/1973
#
# has been resolved.
# Currently, the Habitat `init` and `health_check` hooks run directly from the main loop
# of the Habitat supervisor. If these hooks hang or take too long to run, they can block
# execution of the supervisor.
