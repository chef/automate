# Sample data service

Sample data service can be used to send scheduled data to Automate mimicking the data that would be sent from a client.

The goal is to make it simple for someone with a data collector message to add it to the collection of sample data so we can collect samples from different real life scenarios, such as a windows desktop, an ubuntu server, an apple laptop, etc.
