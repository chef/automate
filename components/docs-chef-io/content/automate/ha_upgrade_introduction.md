**Upgradation** replaces an older version with an improved newer version with some new features or/and fixes for bugs that were present in older versions. Use the --major flag to upgrade from the latest to a major version. This section will talk about the version upgrade of Chef Automate with its possible scenarios.

{{< note >}} Unlike some of the other chef services, Automate HA won't upgrade from one minor version to another. Upgrade Automate HA manually by running the command. {{< /note >}}

## Release Channels

The Chef Automate upgrade process uses **release channels** to allow greater control over the automatic upgrades applied to your system. Chef Automate pulls the latest release within a specified release channel. The default channel is the `current` channel.

To change the release channel that is used for upgrades, modify the `channel` setting in your `config.toml` file:

```toml
channel = "current"
```

## Disable Automatic Upgrades

You can disable automatic upgrades by changing the `upgrade_strategy` setting to `none` in your `config.toml`:

```toml
upgrade_strategy = "none"
```

To manually initiate a minor upgrade, run:

```shell
chef-automate upgrade run
```

To manually initiate a major upgrade, run:

```shell
chef-automate upgrade run --major
```

This command upgrades Chef Automate to the latest version available from your release channel.
