<!-- !-- Chef going to give storage calculator for a customer to provide req and derive their infrastructure.. this calc will be loaded into the doc page?? -->

This page explains how to deploy Chef Automate High Availability (HA) in your network premises/ infrastructure using Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Prerequisite

Based on the number of nodes, the virtual machine requirements for AWS deployment are as follows:

| Instance          | Type         | RAM                                                   | Volume Size         | Volume Type | Volume iops |
| :---------------  | :----------  | :---------------------------------------------------  | :-----------------  | :---------  | :---------  |
| PostgreSQL        | t3.medium    | 4 GB RAM for test and 8 GB for production. vCPU - 2.  | 50 GB (dedicated hard disk space assigned to '/'). | |gp2 | | 150 |
| Opensearch     | m5.large     | 8 GB RAM for test and 16 GB for production. vCPU - 2. | 50 GB (dedicated hard disk space assigned to '/'). | |gp2 | | 300 |
| Chef Automate     | t3.medium    | 4 GB RAM for test and 8 GB for production. vCPU - 2.  | 50 GB (dedicated hard disk space assigned to '/'). | |gp2 | | 100 |
| Chef Infra Server | t3.medium    | 4 GB RAM for test and 8 GB for production. vCPU - 2.  | 50 GB (dedicated hard disk space assigned to '/'). | |gp2 | | 100 |

{{< note >}}

ES volume size also depends on the number of nodes and frequency of Chef Infra Client runs and compliance scans. The above table includes instancesâ€™ RAM and volume size, set up for testing purposes. Production depends on the number of nodes and the frequency of Chef Infra Client runs and compliance scans. However, for on-premises deployment, you can choose the above requirements for VM like RAM.

For **Opensearch** and **PostgresSQL**, a minimum of three node clusters is required.

## Deploy Procedure

To deploy Chef Automate HA, execute the following steps in the listed order:

1. Set up the [Prerequisites for Chef Automate HA Deployment]({{< relref "ha_platform_support.md" >}}).
1. Obtain an AWS account or if you already have one, sign on to your AWS account.
1. Setup the [Bastion Host AWS requirements]({{< relref "ha_bastion.md#Bastion Host Requirements for AWS (Amazon Web Services)" >}}).
1. Configure [Bastion Host for AWS]({{< relref "ha_aws_bastion.md#Bastion Host Configuration" >}}).
1. Ensure you have [Chef Automate utility]({{< relref "ha_auto_install.md" >}}) installed, else download and install the latest version.
1. Connect your [Bastion host to your AWS instance]({{< relref "ha_aws_ssh_connect_bastion.md" >}}).
1. Create an [AWS Identity and Access Management IAM user]({{< relref "ha_iam_user.md" >}}).
1. Create the certificate for the Chef Automate and Chef Server load balancers.
1. [Create the certificates]({{< relref "ha_cert_selfsign.md" >}}) for security and authentication purposes. _optional_
1. [Rotate the certificates]({{< relref "ha_cert_rotaion.md" >}}) if the certificates are expired or compromised. _optional_
1. Enable **dnshostname** in VPC, which determines whether the VPC supports assigning public DNS hostnames to instances with public IP addresses.
1. Execute [AWS Deployment commands]({{< relref "ha_aws_deploy_steps.md" >}}) to provision the Chef Automate HA on your cloud network infrastructure.
1. Execute the [Chef Automate HA deployment commands]({{< relref "ha_aws_deploy_steps.md" >}}).

{{< note >}}

A DNS hostname uniquely names a computer and consists of a hostname and a domain name. DNS servers resolve DNS hostnames to their corresponding IP addresses. To set up DNS in your VPC, ensure that DNS hostnames and DNS resolution are enabled in your VPC.

Refer to [Setting up DNS in Your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/set-up-vpc-dns.html) page.

If the DNS attributes **enableDnsSupport** and **enableDnsHostnames** are true, instances in the VPC are set with public DNS hostnames. The default for these attributes is `false` when the VPC is a default VPC or the VPC is created using the VPC console wizard.

## AWS Infrastructure Resources

The Chef Automate HA deployment using AWS creates the following network resources:

- Three instances for OpenSearch node.

- Three instances for PostgreSQL node.

- One instance for Chef Automate server. However, we can add more instances for the Chef Automate server based on your requirements.

- One instance for Chef Infra Server each. However, we can add more instances for the Chef Infra server based on your requirements.

- Two load balancers and two respective target groups. One each for the Chef Automate server and Chef Infra server.

{{< figure src="/images/automate/ha_aws_resources2.png" alt="Chef Automate HA Load Balancers and Target Groups">}}

- Elastic File System (EFS) for backup of all the instances.

{{< figure src="/images/automate/ha_aws_resources3.png" alt="Chef Automate HA EFS Backup">}}

- Three private subnets (with no internet access) and three public subnets (with internet access).

{{< figure src="/images/automate/ha_aws_resources4.png" alt="Chef Automate HA Public and Private Subnets">}}

- One route table.

- One Elastic IP address.

## Clear AWS Deployment Infrastructure

Follow these steps to delete the **Terraform** and **HA Deployment Infrastructure**:

1. Navigate to the Chef Automate workspace folder where we have deployed HA. For example, `cd /hab/a2_deploy_workspace/terraform`.

1. Execute the command `terraform destroy`. This command removes the terraform deployed at your workspace and all the instances.

1. Execute the command `rm -rf /hab/a2_deploy_workspace`. This command removes the workspace.
