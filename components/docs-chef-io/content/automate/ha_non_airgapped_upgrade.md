This page lists the commands that aid in upgrading the Chef Automate High Availability (HA) frontend and backend clusters in your network infrastructure.

{{< note >}}

- The backend nodes' upgrade restarts **OpenSearch** and **PostgreSQL** services.

- You cannot downgrade the Automate version. If you intend to install the lower version of the Chef Automate High Availability (HA) system, uninstall the existing version of the same, and destroy the terraform.
