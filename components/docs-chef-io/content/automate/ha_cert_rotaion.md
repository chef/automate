## What are Certificates?

A security certificate is a small data file used as an Internet security technique through which the identity, authenticity and reliability of a website or Web application is established.

Certificates should be rotated periodically, to ensure optimal security.

## How is Certificate Rotation Helpful?

Certificate rotation means the replacement of existing certificates with new ones when any certificate expires or based on your organization policy. A new CA authority is substituted for the old requiring a replacement of root certificate for the cluster.

The certificate rotation is also required when key for a node, client, or CA is compromised. Then, you need to modify the contents of a certificate, for example, to add another DNS name or the IP address of a load balancer through which a node can be reached.  In this case, you  would need to rotate only the node certificates.

## How to Rotate the Certificates

You can generate the required certificates on your own or you can use the existing certificates of your organization. Ensure you execute all the below commands from the `cd /hab/a2_deploy_workspace` path.

Follow these steps to rotate your certificates that are to be used in CheF Automate High Availability (HA):

1. Navigate to your workspace folder. For example, `cd /hab/a2_deploy_workspace`.
1. Type the command, `./scripts/credentials set ssl --rotate all ` and press **Enter**. This command rotates all the certificates of your organization.

{{< note >}}

When you run this command first time, a series of certificates are created and saved in `/hab/a2_deploy_workspace/certs` location. You need to identify the appropriate certificates. For example, to rotate certificates for PostgreSQL, use certificate values into *pg_ssl_private.key*,  *pg_ssl_public.pem*, and *ca_root.pem*. Likewise, to rotate certificates for ElasticSearch, use certificate values into *ca_root.pem*, *es_admin_ssl_private.key*, *es_admin_ssl_public.pem*, *es_ssl_private.key*, *es_ssl_public.pem*, *kibana_ssl_private.key*, *kibana_ssl_public.pem*.

1. For rotating the PostgreSQL certificates, type the command `./scripts/credentials set ssl --pg-ssl` and press **Enter**. .

1. For rotating the elasticsearch certificates, type the command, `./scripts/credentials set ssl --es-ssl` and press **Enter**.

<!-- 4. Copy your *x.509 SSL certs* into the appropriate files in `certs/` folder. -->

<!-- - Place your root certificate into `ca_root.pem file`. -->

<!-- - Place your intermediate CA into the `pem` file. -->

1. If your organization issues certificate from an intermediate CA, then place the respective certificate after the server certificate as per order listed. For example, in `certs/pg_ssl_public.pem`, paste it as them as listed:

- Server Certificate
- Intermediate CA Certificate 1
- Intermediate CA Certificate n

1. Type the command, `./scripts/credentials set ssl` (with the appropriate options) and press **Enter**. This command deploys the nodes.

1. Type the command, `./scripts/credentials set ssl  --help` and press **Enter**. This command provides you information and list of commands related to certificate rotation.

1. For rotating the PostgreSQL credentials, type the command `./scripts/credentials set postgresql --auto` and press **Enter**. .

1. For rotating the elasticsearch credentials, type the command, `./scripts/credentials set elasticsearch --auto` and press **Enter**.
