Chef Automate provides an entire suite of enterprise capabilities for node visibility and compliance. Chef Automate upgrades from one minor version to another automatically. However, Chef Automate will not automatically upgrade to a major version. See the instructions below for manually upgrading Chef Automate from date-based versions to Chef Automate 3.x.

## Upgrade Path to version 3.0.x from 20220329091442

There are four possible upgrade scenarios:

- [Chef Automate with Embedded PostgreSQL]({{< relref "#chef-automate-with-embedded-postgresql" >}})
- [Chef Automate with External PostgreSQL]({{< relref "#chef-automate-with-external-postgresql" >}})
- [Chef Automate in Air-Gapped Environment With Embedded PostgreSQL]({{< relref "#chef-automate-in-air-gapped-environment-with-embedded-postgresql" >}})
- [Chef Automate in Air-Gapped Environment With External PostgreSQL]({{< relref "#chef-automate-in-air-gapped-environment-with-external-postgresql" >}})

{{< note >}}

If you are unsure if your installation of Chef Automate is using an external PostgreSQL database, run `chef-automate config show`. You are using an external PostgreSQL database if `enable=true` is present in the `global.v1.external.postgresql` config setting.

### Chef Automate With Embedded PostgreSQL

To upgrade Chef Automate with embedded PostgreSQL, follow the steps given below:

**Upgrade Chef Automate from version 20220329091442 to 3.0.x**

1. Start a major version upgrade:\
    Here, you will be prompted to accept multiple Pre Upgrade checklist.
    Please ensure to do those actions before upgrade.
    ```sh
    sudo chef-automate upgrade run --major
    ```

Once the upgrade is complete, you will get a list of steps to perform post-upgrade.

**Post Upgrade Steps:**

1. Check the upgrade status of Chef Automate:

    ```sh
    sudo chef-automate upgrade status
    ```
    When the status is up-to-date, move ahead.

2. Migrate your data from PostgreSQL 9.6 to PostgreSQL 13:

    ```sh
    sudo chef-automate post-major-upgrade migrate --data=PG
    ```

3. Verify that all services are running:

    ```sh
    sudo chef-automate status
    ```

4. Verify that all the data is present in your upgraded Chef Automate. If yes, clear the old PostgreSQL 9.6 data:

    ```sh
    sudo chef-automate post-major-upgrade clear-data --data=PG
    ```

### Chef Automate With External PostgreSQL

To upgrade Chef Automate with external PostgreSQL, follow the steps given below:

**Upgrade Chef Automate from version 20220329091442 to 3.0.x**
1. Upgrade your external PostgreSQL database v9.6 to v13.5 manually. See the [external PostgreSQL upgrade]({{< relref "postgres_external_upgrade.md" >}}) documentation. If you have configured *Host*, *Port*, or *Password* of PostgreSQL, patch the new configuration to use Chef Automate.
3. Start major version upgrade:
    ```sh
    sudo chef-automate upgrade run --major
    ```
4. Check upgrade status is up-to-date
    ```sh
    sudo chef-automate status
    ```

### Chef Automate in Air-Gapped Environment With Embedded PostgreSQL

**Upgrade Chef Automate from version 20220329091442 to 3.0.x**

To upgrade to 3.0.x, follow the steps below:
#### On Internet connected machine:
1. Download latest CLI of Chef Automate

    ```sh
    sudo ./chef-automate airgap bundle create
    ```

3. Copy the latest Chef Automate CLI (`chef-automate`) and AIB (`automate_3.0.x.aib`) to the air-gapped machine running Chef Automate.

#### On Air-Gapped machine running Chef Automate:
1. Make sure your upgrade strategy as none in Chef Automate config. Check using:
    ```sh
    sudo ./chef-automate config show
    ```
    Reference to change [upgrade strategy]({{< relref "postgres_external_upgrade.md#upgrade-strategy" >}})

    sudo ./chef-automate airgap bundle create
    ```

3. Copy the latest Chef Automate CLI (`chef-automate`) and AIB (`automate_3.0.x.aib`) to the air-gapped machine running Chef Automate.

#### On Air-Gapped machine running Chef Automate:
1. Make sure your upgrade strategy as none in Chef Automate config. Check using:
    ```sh
    sudo ./chef-automate config show
    ```
    Reference to change [upgrade strategy]({{< relref "postgres_external_upgrade.md#upgrade-strategy" >}})
2. Upgrade your external PostgreSQL database v9.6 to v13.5 manually. See the [external PostgreSQL upgrade]({{< relref "postgres_external_upgrade.md" >}}) documentation. If you have configured *Host*, *Port*, or *Password* of PostgreSQL, patch the new configuration to use Chef Automate.
3. Upgrade using new AIB and Chef Automate CLI:

    ```sh
    sudo ./chef-automate upgrade run --airgap-bundle automate_3.0.x.aib --major
    ```
4. Check upgrade status is up-to-date
    ```sh
    sudo chef-automate status
    ```

## Troubleshooting

If Chef Automate fails to migrate your data to PostgreSQL 13 when running `chef-automate post-major-upgrade migrate --data=PG`, restore the data:
```sh
sudo chef-automate backup restore </path/to/backups/>BACKUP_ID
```
If you have Air-Gapped bundle which you want to restore to, then use this command:
```sh
sudo chef-automate backup restore  --airgap-bundle </path/to/bundle> </path/to/backups/>BACKUP_ID
```
Reference for [Restore methods](/automate/restore/).

Use the backup ID from the backup you created before starting the upgrade.

If the restore fails even after upgrading the Chef Automate version, follow the steps given below:

1. Uninstall Chef Automate:
    ```sh
    sudo chef-automate uninstall
    ```
2. Install the last date-based version (`20220329091442`) using the air-gapped installation process. See the [air-gapped installation](/automate/airgapped_installation/) documentation for more information.

3. Restore the backup:

    ```sh
    sudo chef-automate backup restore <backup_id>
    ```

See the [Chef Automate restore](/automate/restore/) documentation for more information.

{{< note >}}

If you used backup and restore method to migrate data then you will have to remove this file: `/hab/svc/deployment-service/var/upgrade_metadata.json`. To mock completion of post upgrade checklist items.
