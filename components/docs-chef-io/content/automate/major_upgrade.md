Chef Automate provides an entire suite of enterprise capabilities for node visibility and compliance. Chef Automate upgrades from one minor version to another automatically. However, Chef Automatate will not automatically upgrade to a major version. See the instructions below for manually upgrading Chef Automate from date-based versions to Chef Automate 3.

## Upgrade Journey

Please choose following upgrade journey based on your current version of Chef Automate. All of these upgrades are manual upgrades.

| Your Current Version | Upgrade To |
| -------------------- | ---------- |
| Any version before 20220329091442| 20220329091442|
| 20220329091442| 3.0.1|

For example, if today you are on version 2021201164433, then your upgrade journey should be:

1. Manual upgrade to 20220329091442.
1. Manual upgrade to 3.0.1.

## Prerequisites

- **Plan your downtime**: This upgrade requires downtime. Before upgrading, set the environment to handle the downtime.
- **Backup Chef Automate database**: This Chef Automate version upgrades PostgreSQL. [Backup](/automate/backup/) your data before upgrading.

## Upgrade Path

There are four possible upgrade scenarios:

- [Chef Automate with Embedded PostgreSQL]({{< relref "#chef-automate-with-embedded-postgresql" >}})
- [Chef Automate with External PostgreSQL]({{< relref "#chef-automate-with-external-postgresql" >}})
- [Chef Automate in Air-Gapped Environment With Embedded PostgreSQL]({{< relref "#chef-automate-in-air-gapped-environment-with-embedded-postgresql" >}})
- [Chef Automate in Air-Gapped Environment With External PostgreSQL]({{< relref "#chef-automate-in-air-gapped-environment-with-external-postgresql" >}})

{{< note >}}

If you are unsure if your installation of Chef Automate is using an external PostgreSQL database, run `chef-automate config show`. You are using an external PostgreSQL database if `enable=true` is present in the `global.v1.external.postgresql` config setting.

Sixty percent of your drive should be free space before starting a major version upgrade.

## Troubleshooting

If Chef Automate fails to upgrade your database for PostgreSQL 13 when running `chef-automate post-major-upgrade migrate --data=PG`, restore the data:

```sh
sudo chef-automate backup restore </path/to/backups/>BACKUP_ID
```

Use the backup ID from the backup you created before starting the upgrade.

If the restore fails even after upgrading the Chef Automate version, follow the steps given below:

1. Uninstall Chef Automate:

   ```sh
   sudo chef-automate uninstall
   ```

1. Install the last date-based version (`20220329091442`) using the air-gapped installation process. See the [air-gapped installation](/automate/airgapped_installation/) documentation for more information.

1. Restore the backup:

   ```sh
   sudo chef-automate backup restore <backup_id>
   ```

   See the [Chef Automate restore](/automate/restore/) documentation for more information.

{{< note >}}

If you have migrated database using alternative methods, you will see a checklist of steps after running `chef-automate upgrade status` which won’t be marked as complete. To remove those checklist items, run `sudo rm /hab/svc/deployment-service/var/upgrade_metadata.json`.
