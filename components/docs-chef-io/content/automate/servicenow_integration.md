## Chef Automate Integration with CMDB App in ServiceNow

The Chef Automate integration app plugin enables the Chef Automate to create and update client node records to Configuration Management Database (CMDB) tables of ServiceNow. This data aids in aggregating information about client nodes, the client runs, and compliance scans. The client runs and compliance scans monitor the state of configuration and compliance policies of your nodes.

## Chef Automate and ServiceNow Integration

The integration between a Chef Automate server and a ServiceNow instance requires the following components:

- Chef Automate Scoped Application
- Chef Automate Server

The Chef Automate application is a ServiceNow certified scoped application available from the ServiceNow store.  It integrates with the Chef Automate infrastructure and compliance functionality.

The [Chef Automate](https://www.chef.io/automate/) provides a full suite of enterprise capabilities for workflow, node visibility, and compliance. The Chef Automate server sends HTTPS JSON data feeds to the Chef Automate application in a ServiceNow instance to create and update the _ServiceNow CMDB_ tables, the application client run and compliance report tables.

### Installing Chef Automate application in ServiceNow

The Chef Automate application exposes the REST API endpoint that facilitates the communication between Chef Automate and the ServiceNow instance.

1. Visit the ServiceNow store at <https://store.servicenow.com>.
2. Get the **Chef Automate Integration App** application.
3. Navigate to the ServiceNow instance.
4. Select **System Applications** > **All Available Applications** > **All** menu.
5. Find the application using the filter criteria and search bar.
   Note that you can search for the application by its Name or ID. If you cannot find an application, you may have to request it from the ServiceNow Store.
6. Click **Install**.

### Creating Application Users

The Chef Automate application provides several roles appropriate for integration. You can assign the following roles to the existing or new ServiceNow users:

[Role x_chef_automate.admin]({{< relref "Role x_chef_automate.admin" >}}))
[Role x_chef_automate.user]({{< relref "Role x_chef_automate.user" >}})
[Role x_chef_automate.api]({{< relref "Role x_chef_automate.api" >}})

These roles are part of the package. You can create the requisite roles and controls if any further restrictions are needed.

## Configuration

You can configure Chef Automate either using ServiceNow or using the Chef Automate UI.

{{< note >}}

- You can configure `feed_interval` setting to **2 or 8 hours** based on the number of nodes. If more nodes are required, then you must increase the `feed_interval`.
- The benchmark with `node_batch_size` set as **15** is tested. You can set the value between **1** and **30**.
- The size of Scans can be large as multiple profiles are run. Hence, you must retain the `node_bach_size` smaller to avoid **4MB GRPC** limits exceeding.

## Navigation

In ServiceNow, the navigation of the application is through the **Chef Automate** menu.

{{< figure src="/images/automate/snow_integration_navigation.png" alt="Navigation">}}

The **Automate Instances** module allows the user to configure the integration with Chef Automate. The **Server** module displays a list of servers in the _CMDB_ module.

The Chef Automate integration augments the existing CMDB servers and inserts new servers into CMDB. The application uses the ServiceNow Discovery IRE (Identification and Reconciliation Engine) when inserting or updating servers.

In addition, the application updates the CMDB file systems and software installed tables and adds related information on the servers with associated data from Chef Automate:

- Client Runs
- Attributes
- Compliance Reports

### Client Runs

The user can drill down into **Client Run** detail from a server record by clicking the name on an individual Client Run. Client Run record displays related information for:

- Client run cookbooks: cookbooks executed during the client run.
- Client run lists: run lists executed during the client run.
- Client run recipes: recipes executed during the client run.

The entire Chef Client Run details are available for each server. In addition, Client runs are also available from the **Client Runs** module.

### Attributes

The user can drill down into the current server attributes detail from a server record by clicking on the attributes record. The entire OHAI attributes are available for each server.

### Compliance Reports

The user can drill down into **Compliance** report detail from a server record by clicking the name on an individual **Compliance** report. The Compliance Report record displays related information for:

- Compliance report profiles: all profiles executed during the compliance scan.
- Compliance report results: all results from the compliance scan.

In addition, the user can drill down into each **Compliance** report profile to view the individual results for each profile. The entire Chef Compliance Report details are available for each server. Compliance reports are also available from the **Compliance** report module.

### Benchmarking

The Chef Automate Installation team has tested the integration of the ServiceNow app with a maximum of 10K nodes Client Run data. Beyond this range, there might be performance issues. Also, the performance may get affected if you have any other applications running in your environment.

The typical production instance of ServiceNow can have 8-12 nodes, which would mean the performance will be +10K nodes per hour processed with client run data. Benchmarking indicates that the increase in the number of nodes in the ServiceNow instance reduces the processing time.

| Client Nodes  | Total Time Taken (Dev 1 Node)  | Total Time Taken (Vendor 2 Node)  |
|---------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 200           | 7m48s                          | 4m4s                              |
| 500           | 17m47s                         | 10m16s                            |
| 2000          | 1h15m                          | 45m                               |
| 10,000        | 5h40m                          | 3h3m                              |
