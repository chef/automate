A [Bastion Host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_host#:~:text=A%20bastion%20host%20is%20a,the%20threat%20to%20the%20computer.) is a special-purpose computer or server on a network specifically designed and configured to withstand attacks. This serve type generally hosts a single application or process, for example, a proxy server or load balancer. All other services are limited to reduce the threat to the computer.

Its purpose is to provide access to a private network from an external network, such as the Internet or outside of a firewall and involves access from untrusted networks or computers. These computers are also equipped with special networking interfaces to withstand high-bandwidth attacks through the internet.

Bastion servers are instances that reside within your public subnet and are accessed using SSH. The purpose of a bastion host is to restrict access to a private network from an external network. Once remote connectivity establishes with the bastion host, it allows you to use SSH to log in to other instances (within private subnets) deeper within your network.

The bastion hosts provide secure access to Linux instances located in the private and public subnets.

## Bastion Host for Chef Automate High Availability (HA)

The Virtual machine is required for either of the Chef Automate HA deployment types to trigger the deployment, which is actually a bastion host. This section explains the bastion host requirements and configurations for the two deployment modes of the Chef Automate HA.

### Bastion Host Requirements for On-Premise Deployment

- Instance type: 2 vCPU
- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04
- Memory: Minimum of 4GB
- Hard Disk Space - 100 GB
- Ports to be publicly accessible: 22 and 9631

### Bastion Host Requirements for AWS (Amazon Web Services)

- [AWS Credential configured on your bastion host](( {{< relref "ha_configure_aws_credentials.md" >}} )).
- Create the certificate for the DNS
- Operating System (OS): Bastion host with Ubuntu 20.04 or centOs-7 or RHEL-7
- AWS instance type: *t2.medium*
- Memory: Minimum of 4GB
- Hard Disk Space - 100 GB
