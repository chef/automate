The Chef Automate Incident Creation app for ServiceNow, also called the Incident App, integrates Chef Automate with ServiceNow. This app is a ServiceNow-certified app available from the [ServiceNow](https://store.servicenow.com) store that enables you to automatically generate incidents in the ServiceNow Incident Management environment whenever you have any failures in your Chef-managed platform. These failures are due to either infrastructure automation updates or automated compliance check failures. This integration with ServiceNow allows you to capture all failures across your automated infrastructure for resolution and tracking purposes by improving the effectiveness of both ServiceNow and Chef Automate applications and help reduce the entire repercussions of any failure scenarios.

The Incident App exposes the REST API endpoint for communication between Chef Automate and the ServiceNow instance. Chef Automate sends HTTPS JSON notifications to the Incident App in a ServiceNow instance to creates and update incident failures.

## Key Features of Chef Automate Incident Creation App

* Incident management for infrastructure and compliance automation. Create ServiceNow incident tickets, alert and page operations for Chef failures or InSpec failures automatically. provide a resolution to the automation and compliance failures at the earliest and in concordance with a customer- or regulatory-mandated SLAs or OLAs.

* Intelligent data management and event de-duplication. Promotes Chef Automate as a central data aggregator and restricts opening of a new incident tickets for the repeated failures by updating relevant fields in ServiceNow, such as the time of last failure. This helps reduce alert noise, in contrast to non-Chef Automate approaches that send data directly from managed nodes to ServiceNow.

* Compliance-related integration opportunities with other capabilities on ServiceNow. Data stream of compliance events generated by the integration with ServiceNow leverages other applications on the ServiceNow platform. For example, governance and risk compliance (GRC) or security/incident management (SIEM) systems that have integrations with ServiceNow can now have access to this data. The data stream from InSpec through Chef Automate allows you to enhance the entire risk dashboard with real-time, continuous prioritized compliance events, rather than inundating the standardized data streams with meaningless, context-free data.

## Prerequisites

- The [Integration App]({{< relref "servicenow_integration" >}}) is already installed and configured.
- Your unique ServiceNow URL. It has the format: `https://ven12345.service-now.com`.
- Setting up the Incident App requires the `x_chef_automate.api` role to configure it. Ask an Integration App or ServiceNow administrator to enable this for you.

## Installation

Get the app from the [ServiceNow](https://store.servicenow.com) store and then install it to your account from the **Service Management** dashboard.

## Setup

You can setup automatic incident creation for:

* Chef Infra Client failures
* Chef InSpec scan failures

`/api/x_chef_incident/inspec_scan`
`/api/x_chef_incident/client_run`

{{% servicenow_incidents %}}

## Setup

The Chef Automate Incident App has nine configurable **Application Properties**. You must have the `admin` or `x_chef_incident.admin` roles to change the default values in the **Application Properties**.

To change the Incident App properties:

1. Find **Chef Incidents** in ServiceNow
1. Select **Chef Incidents** > **Properties** from the navigation.
1. Enter your changes in the **Chef Incident Properties** form.
1. Select **Save**.

### Incident App Properties

`x_chef_incident.association`
: Used to associate a Chef Infra Client run record with an Incident record. The possible values are: `cookbook` and `node`. Default: `cookbook`.

   Setting the value to `cookbook` creates an incident for the failed cookbook. All failing Chef Infra Client runs on nodes associates with the corresponding incident. `cookbook` is the default value as the number of nodes exceeds the number of cookbooks. The short description of the incident indicates the failed cookbook:

   ![CCR Failed Cookbook Description](/images/automate/SNOW_Failed_Cookbook.png)

   The **Chef Infra Client runs** tab of the incident displays the associated client runs. Setting the value to `node` creates an incident for each failed node. All failing Chef Infra Client runs for a node associates with the corresponding incident. The short description of the incident indicates the failed node.

`x_chef_incident.scan_association`

: Used to associate the Chef InSpec scan record with an incident record. The possible values are: `profile` and `node`. Deault: `profile`.

   Setting the value to `profile` creates an incident for the failed Chef InSpec compliance profile. All Chef InSpec scans on failing nodes associates with the corresponding incident. `profile` is the default value as the number of nodes exceeds the number of profiles. The short description of the incident indicates the failed profile.

   ![Scan Failed Profile Description](/images/automate/SNOW_Failed_Profile_Scan.png)

   The **Chef InSpec scans** tab of the incident displays the associated Chef InSpec scans. Setting the value to `node` creates an incident for each failed node. All Chef InSpec scans failing for a node associates with the corresponding incident. The short description of the incident indicates the failed node.

`x_chef_incident.assigned_to`

: Used to set up the ServiceNow user ID to assign incidents raised by the application. The corresponding group assigns automatically to the incident if the user is in an assignment group. Default: `blank`.

`x_chef_incident.assignment_group`

: Used to set up a group rather than an individual user in the `x_chef_incident.assigned_to` property to assign the incident to a group. Default: `blank`.

`x_chef_incident.impact`

: Used to set an impact value in an incident raised by the application. Possible values are `1`, `2` or `3`. Default: `2`.

`x_chef_incident.urgency`

: Used to set an urgency value in an incident raised by the application. Possible values are `1`, `2` or `3`. Default: `2`.

`x_chef_incident.retention_days`

: Used to define number of days to maintain the Chef Infra Client run and Chef InSpec scan records in ServiceNow. Default: `30`.

   The ServiceNow app deletes these records of the corresponding closed incidents, deleted incidents, and the removed incidents from the Chef Infra Client run or Chef InSpec scan record by a user update.

`x_chef_incident.logging.enabled`

: Used to flag the logging with **enable** or **disable** status. Once enabled, you can view the logs from the **Chef incidents** > **Logs** menu and the **System logs** > **Application logs** menu by authorized users. Default: `No`.

`x_chef_incident.logging.verbosity`

: Used to debug the data in ServiceNow. Enables the selected logging level and is visible in logs. The possible values are `debug`, `warn`, `info`, and `error`. Default: `error`.
