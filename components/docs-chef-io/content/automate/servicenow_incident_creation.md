[ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/) provides cloud-based services that automate enterprise IT operations. ServiceNow
specializes in IT service management (ITSM) applications and provides forms-based workflow application development. It supports
third-party applications and data integrations. The most common integrations are configuration management database (CMDB),
incident management, problem management, change management, user administration, and single sign-on authentication.

The Chef Automate Incident Creation app for ServiceNow integrates Chef Automate with ServiceNow. This app is a ServiceNow-certified app available from the [ServiceNow](https://store.servicenow.com) store that enables you to generate incidents in the ServiceNow Incident Management environment whenever you have any failures in your Chef-managed platform. These failures are due to either infrastructure automation updates or automated compliance check failures. This integration with ServiceNow allows you to capture all failures across your automated infrastructure for resolution and tracking purposes by improving the effectiveness of both ServiceNow and Chef Automate applications and help reduce the entire repercussions of any failure scenarios.

## Key Features of Chef Automate Incident Creation App

* Incident management for infrastructure and compliance automation &mdash; Creates ServiceNow incident tickets, alert/page operations or information security (for Chef failures or InSpec failures, respectively) to provide a resolution to the automation and compliance failures at the earliest and in concordance with a customer- or regulatory-mandated SLAs or OLAs.

* Intelligent data management and event de-duplication &mdash; Promotes Chef Automate as a central data aggregator and restricts opening of a new incident tickets for the repeated failures by updating relevant fields in ServiceNow, such as the time of last failure. This helps reduce alert noise, in contrast to non-Chef Automate approaches that send data directly from managed nodes to ServiceNow.

* Compliance-related integration opportunities with other capabilities on ServiceNow &mdash; Data stream of compliance events generated by the integration with ServiceNow leverages other applications on the ServiceNow platform. For example, governance and risk compliance (GRC) or security/incident management (SIEM) systems that have integrations with ServiceNow can now have access to this data. The data stream from InSpec through Chef Automate allows you to enhance the entire risk dashboard with real-time, continuous prioritized compliance events, rather than inundating the standardized data streams with meaningless, context-free data.

## Installation

[Chef Automate](https://docs.chef.io/automate/) provides a full suite of enterprise capabilities for workflow, node visibility, and compliance. The integration between a Chef Automate server and a ServiceNow instance requires the following components:

* Chef Automate Certified Application
* Chef Automate Server

The installation personnel performing the task of integrating the Chef Automate Incident app in the ServiceNow ecosystem must have a basic understanding of the ServiceNow system.

### System Requirements

The ServiceNow instance must be reachable on port **443** from Chef Automate.

### Software Requirements

A running [Chef Automate](https://www.chef.io/products/chef-automate) instance.
A running [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/) instance.

### Required ServiceNow Plugins

Install following ServiceNow plugins:

* System Import Sets com.glide.system_import_set, min version 1.0.0.
* Chef Automate Incident Creation 1.0.0 or higher
* [Chef Automate Server Installation](https://docs.chef.io/automate/install/).
* Chef Automate 2 Server

Locate the **System Import Sets** plugin by navigating to the **System Applications** > **All Available Applications** > **All** section in the ServiceNow application.

{{< figure src="/images/automate/snow_incident_plugin.png" alt="System Import Set Plugin">}}

### Install the Chef Automate Incident Creation App

The Chef Automate Incident Creation app exposes the REST API endpoint for communication between Chef Automate and the ServiceNow instance. Chef Automate sends HTTPS JSON notifications to the Chef Automate Incident Creation app in a ServiceNow instance to creates and update incident failures.

1. Navigate to the [ServiceNow](https://store.servicenow.com) store.
2. Search for **Chef Automate**.
3. Select the **Chef Automate Incident Creation App**.
4. Select **Get** and follow the instructions by specifying your ServiceNow credentials.
5. Open your **ServiceNow Service Management** application.
6. Select **System Applications** > **All Available Applications** > **All** menu.
7. Find the application using the filter criteria and search bar.
   You can search for the application by its `Name` or `ID`. If you cannot find an application, you may have to request it from the ServiceNow Store.
8. Select **Install**.

### Assign User Roles

The ServiceNow users must have the `x_chef_automate.api` role to set up the ServiceNow instance to receive data from Chef Automate. Changing the **Application Properties** defaults requires the `x_chef_automate.admin` role.

The Chef Automate Incident app has three default roles:

* [Role x_chef_incident.admin]({{< relref "#role_x_chef_incident.admin" >}})
* [Role x_chef_incident.user]({{< relref "#role_x_chef_incident.user" >}})
* [Role x_chef_incident.api]({{< relref "#role_x_chef_incident.api" >}})

You can assign these roles to the existing or new ServiceNow users. These roles are part of the package. If there is a need for further restrictions, you can create the required roles and controls. Also, you can associate a single user with more than one role.

The `x_chef_incident.user` role is suitable for those users who require application access without administration rights. To alter the system properties, you need to have the `x_chef_incident.admin` role.

Refer to the following pages on how to create users and assign roles in ServiceNow:

* [Creating Users in ServiceNow](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=t_CreateAUser.html)
* [Assigning Roles in ServiceNow](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=t_AssignARoleToAUser.html)

## Configuration

You can configure Chef Automate to send a notification to ServiceNow with REST APIs details exposed by the Chef Automate application, which are as follows:

* Chef Infra Client run API: `/api/x_chef_incident/client_run`
* Chef InSpec scan API: `/api/x_chef_incident/inspec_scan`
