This section will discuss deploying Chef Automate HA on-premise machines or on existing VMs. The steps are as follows:

## Install Chef Automate HA

### Prerequisites

- All VMs or Machines are up and running.
- OS Root Volume (/) must be at least 40 GB.
- TMP space (/var/tmp) must be at least 5GB.
- Separate Hab volume (/hab) provisioned at least 100 GB for OpenSearch node `/hab` volume will be more based on the data retention policy.
- A Common user has access to all machines.
- This common user should have sudo privileges.
- This common user uses the same SSH Private Key file to access all machines.
- Key-based SSH for the provisioning user for all the machines for HA-Deployment.
- We do not support passphrases for Private Key authentication.
- LoadBalancers are set up according to [Chef Automate HA Architecture](/automate/ha/) needs as explained in [Load Balancer Configuration page](/automate/loadbalancer_configuration/).
- Network ports are opened as per [Chef Automate Architecture](/automate/ha/) needs as explained in [Security and Firewall page](/automate/ha_on_premises_deployment_prerequisites/#firewall-checks).
- Make sure your Linux has the `sysctl` utility available in all Machines.
- DNS is configured to redirect `chefautomate.example.com` to the Primary Load Balancer.
- DNS is configured to redirect `chefinfraserver.example.com` to the Primary Load Balancer.
- Certificates are created and added for the chefautomate.example.com, and `chefinfraserver.example.com` in the Load Balancers.
- If DNS is not used, add the records to `/etc/hosts` in all the machines, including Bastion:

```bash
sudo sed '/127.0.0.1/a \\n<Primary_LoadBalancer_IP> chefautomate.example.com\n<Primary_LoadBalancer_IP> chefinfraserver.example.com\n' -i /etc/hosts
```

- If the instance is **RedHat**, set SElinux config `enforcing` to `permissive` in all the nodes. SSH to each node, then run:

```bash
sudo sed -i 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=permissive/g' /etc/selinux/config
```

{{< warning >}}

- PLEASE DO NOT MODIFY THE WORKSPACE PATH; it should always be "/hab/a2_deploy_workspace".
- We currently don't support AD managed users in nodes. We only support local Linux users.
- If you have configured a sudo password for the user, you must create an environment variable `sudo_password` and set the password as the variable's value. Example: `export sudo_password=<password>`. And then, run all sudo commands with the `sudo -E or --preserve-env` option. Example: `sudo -E ./chef-automate deploy config.toml --airgap-bundle automate.aib`. This is required for the `chef-automate` CLI to run the commands with sudo privileges. Please refer [this](/automate/ha_sudo_password/) for details.

{{< /warning >}}

### Steps to run on Bastion Host Machine

1. Run the below commands to download the latest Automate CLI and Airgapped Bundle:

    ```bash
    #Run commands as sudo.
    sudo -- sh -c "
    #Download Chef Automate CLI.
    curl https://packages.chef.io/files/current/latest/chef-automate-cli/chef-automate_linux_amd64.zip \
    | gunzip - > chef-automate && chmod +x chef-automate \
    | cp -f chef-automate /usr/bin/chef-automate
    #Download the latest Airgapped Bundle.
    #To download specific version bundle, example version: 4.2.59 then replace latest.aib with 4.2.59.aib
    curl https://packages.chef.io/airgap_bundle/current/automate/latest.aib -o automate.aib
    "
    ```

    {{< note spaces=4 >}}
    Chef Automate bundles are available for 365 days from the release of a version. However, the milestone release bundles are available for download forever.
    {{< /note >}}

    {{< note >}} If the Airgapped Bastion machine differs, transfer the Bundle file (`latest.aib`) and Chef Automate CLI binary (`chef-automate`) to the Airgapped Bastion Machine using the `scp` command. {{< /note >}}

    After transferring, in Airgapped Bastion, run the below commands:

    ```bash
    #Run commands as sudo.
    sudo -- sh -c "
    #Move the Chef Automate CLI to `/usr/bin`.
    cp -f chef-automate /usr/bin/chef-automate
    "
    ```
##### Steps to generate config
1. Generate config using the below command and provide:

    ```bash
    sudo -- sh -c "
    #Generate config for Automate Ha Deployment
    chef-automate config gen config.toml
    "
    ```
    Click [here](/automate/ha_config_gen) to know more about generating config

##### Steps to deploy

1. Continue with the deployment after generating the config:

    ```bash
    #Run commands as sudo.
    sudo -- sh -c "
    #Print data in the config
    cat config.toml
    #Run deploy command to deploy `automate.aib` with set `config.toml`
    chef-automate deploy config.toml --airgap-bundle automate.aib
    "
    ```
1. Verify the deployment by checking status summary
    ```bash
    #Run commands as sudo.
    sudo -- sh -c "
    #After Deployment is done successfully. Check the status of Chef Automate HA services
    chef-automate status summary
    "
    ```

    Check if Chef Automate UI is accessible by going to (Domain used for Chef Automate) [https://chefautomate.example.com](https://chefautomate.example.com).
    After successful deployment, proceed with following...
      1. Create user and orgs, Click [here](/automate/ha_node_bootstraping/#create-users-and-organization) to learn more about user and org creation
      1. Workstation setup, Click [here](/automate/ha_node_bootstraping/#workstation-setup) to learn more about workstation setup
      1. Node bootstrapping,  Click [here](/automate/ha_node_bootstraping/#bootstraping-a-node) to learn more about node bootstraping.

### Sample Config

{{< note >}}

- Assuming 10+1 nodes (1 bastion, 2 for automate UI, 2 for Chef-server, 3 for Postgresql, 3 for OpenSearch).
- The following config will, by default, leave the backup configuration empty.
- To provide multiline certificates use triple quotes like `""" multiline certificate contents"""`.

## Add More Nodes to the OnPremises Deployment

The commands require some arguments so that it can determine which types of nodes you want to add to your HA setup from your bastion host. It needs the IP addresses of the nodes you want to add as comma-separate values with no spaces in between.

For example,

- if you want to add nodes with IP 10.1.2.23 to automate, you have to run the:

    ```sh
    chef-automate node add --automate-ips 10.1.2.23
    ```

- If you want to add nodes with IP 10.1.2.23 and 10.0.1.42 to the chef-server, you have to run the:

    ```sh
    chef-automate node add --chef-server-ips 10.1.2.23,10.0.1.42
    ```

- If you want to add nodes with IP 10.1.2.23 and 10.0.1.42 to OpenSearch, you have to run the:

    ```sh
    chef-automate node add --opensearch-ips 10.1.2.23,10.0.1.42
    ```

- If you want to add nodes with IP 10.1.2.23, 10.0.1.54 and 10.0.1.42 to PostgreSQL you have to run:

    ```sh
    chef-automate node add --postgresql-ips 10.1.2.23,10.0.1.42,10.0.1.54
    ```

You can mix and match different services to add nodes across various services.

- If you want to add nodes with IP 10.1.2.23 to automate and nodes with IP 10.0.1.54 and 10.0.1.42 to PostgreSQL, you have to run:

    ```sh
    chef-automate node add --automate-ips 10.1.2.23 --postgresql-ips 10.0.1.42,10.0.1.54
    ```

- If you want to add nodes with IP 10.1.2.23 to automate, nodes with IP 10.1.0.36 and 10.0.1.233 to chef-server, and nodes with IP 10.0.1.54 and 10.0.1.42 to PostgreSQL you have to run:

    ```sh
    chef-automate node add --automate-ips 10.1.2.23 --chef-server-ips 10.1.0.36,10.0.1.233  --postgresql-ips 10.0.1.42,10.0.1.54
    ```

Once the command executes, it will add the supplied nodes to your automate setup. The changes might take a while.

- Make sure to update your loadbalancer configuration with the IP address of the new node. For reference, check [Load Balancer Configuration page](/automate/loadbalancer_configuration/)

{{< note >}}

- If you have patched some external config to any existing services, then apply the same on the new nodes.
For example, if you have patched any external configurations like SAML or LDAP or any other done manually post-deployment in automate nodes, make sure to patch those configurations on the new automate nodes. The same must be followed for services like Chef-Server, Postgresql, and OpenSearch.
- The new node will be configured with the certificates already configured in your HA setup.
- If you had applied unique certificates per node, then the certificates of one of the nodes have been applied by default on the new nodes.
- If you want to change the certificates for the new nodes, you can manually run the `chef-automate cert-rotate [options]` command.

{{< /note >}}

{{< warning >}}
It's essential to ensure that the IP address of the nodes you are trying to add has sufficient resources and is reachable from the bastion host.
{{< /warning >}}

## Remove Single Node From Cluster on OnPremises Deployment

{{< warning >}}

- We do not recommend the removal of any node from the backend cluster, but replacing the node is recommended. For the replacement of a node, click [here](#replace-node-in-automate-ha-cluster) for reference.
- Removal of nodes for Postgresql or OpenSearch is at your own risk and may result in data loss. Consult your database administrator before trying to delete Postgresql or OpenSearch nodes.
- Below process can be done for `chef-server` and `automate`.
- Only one node can be removed simultaneously, irrespective of node type.

{{< /warning >}}

The command requires some arguments to determine which types of nodes you want to remove from your HA setup from your bastion host. It needs the IP address of the node you want to remove.
For example,

- If you want to remove the node of automate, you have to run the:

    ```sh
    chef-automate node remove --automate-ip "<automate-ip-address>"
    ```

- If you want to remove the node of the chef-server, you have to run the:

    ```sh
    chef-automate node remove --chef-server-ip "<chef-server-ip-address>"
    ```

- If you want to remove the node of OpenSearch, you have to run the:

    ```sh
    chef-automate node remove --opensearch-ip "<opensearch-ip-address>"
    ```

- If you want to remove the node of PostgreSQL, you have to run:

    ```sh
    chef-automate node remove --postgresql-ip "<postgresql-ip-address>"
    ```

Once the command executes, it will remove the supplied node from your HA setup. The changes might take a while.

- Make sure to remove the IP address of the deleted node from your loadbalancer configuration. For reference, check [Load Balancer Configuration page](/automate/loadbalancer_configuration/)

{{< note >}}

- The IPs provided must be associated with a node in your HA setup.
- Automate instance count cannot be less than 1.
- Chef Server instance count cannot be less than 1.
- Open search instance count cannot be less than 3.
- Postgresql instance count cannot be less than 3.

{{< /note >}}

## Replace Node in Automate HA Cluster

- Add a New Node following [this](#add-more-nodes-to-the-onprem-deployment).
- Stop the Habitat Supervisor on the node .i.e; going to be removed, use the `systemctl stop hab-sup` command to stop the
  habitat supervisor.
- Remove an Existing Node following [this](#remove-single-node-from-cluster-on-onprem-deployment).

## Uninstall Chef automate HA

{{< danger >}}
The below section will uninstall the chef automate HA
{{< /danger >}}

### To Uninstall On-Premise

To uninstall Chef Automate HA instances after unsuccessful deployment, run the below command in your bastion host.

```bash
    chef-automate cleanup --onprem-deployment
```

## Troubleshooting

### Failure to Replace Nodes

```bash
Error: Upload failed: scp: /var/automate-ha: Permission denied
```

- **Resolution**: Execute the below command.

  ```sh
  cd /hab/a2_deploy_workspace/terraform
  for x in $(terraform state list -state=/hab/a2_deploy_workspace/terraform/terraform.tfstate | grep module); do terraform taint $x; done
  cd -
  ```

- Run the `deploy` command again once the module's tainted.

  ```sh
  chef-automate deploy config.toml --airgap-bundle <Path-to-the-airgap-bundle>
  ```
