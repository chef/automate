Before running Chef Automate, you must accept the Chef EULA.

Chef Automate offers two license tiers that have different entitlements:

* **Trial:** A trial license is for users or organizations interested in exploring the product before buying.
* **Commercial:** A commercial license is for customers who have purchased and are entitled to use it according to the license terms.

Chef Automate is built around a web user interface that provides visibility into all aspects of your infrastructure. The licensing types will affect your UI journey.

For more information on Chef licenses, see [Chef licensing documentation](https://docs.chef.io/licensing/).

Following are some of the scenarios that will occur when you use the Chef Automate web user interface:

## When the trial license is about to expire

If you are using a trial license, Chef Automate web UI will notify you when your license is about to expire.
