Before running Chef Automate, you must accept the Chef EULA.

Chef Automate offers two license tiers that have different entitlements:

* **Trial:** A trial license is for users or organizations interested in exploring the product before buying.
* **Commercial:** A commercial license is for customers who have purchased and are entitled to use it according to the license terms.

Chef Automate is built around a web user interface that provides visibility into all aspects of your infrastructure. The licensing types will affect your UI journey.

For more information on Chef licenses, see [Chefâ€™s licensing documentation](https://docs.chef.io/licensing/).

## Web User Interface




Once a license expires, a user cannot use Chef Automate features and capabilities. All trial licenses will cease to operate once the expiry date has elapsed. Users with commercial licenses can continue to use the product for a grace period of 60 days, after which all operations on the product will be restricted. All impacted users will have to request a new license upon the expiry of their existing license.
