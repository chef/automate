Follow the steps below to deploy Chef Automate High Availability (HA) on AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud with Managed AWS Services.

## Install Chef Automate HA on AWS with Managed AWS Services

### Prerequisites

- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) should be created in AWS before starting. Reference for [VPC and CIDR creation](/automate/ha_vpc_setup/)
- If you want to use Default VPC, then you have to create Public and Private Subnet, if subnet are not available. Please refer [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/default-vpc.html)
- We need 3 private and 3 public subnet in a vpc (1 subnet for each AZ). As of now we support dedicate subnet for each AZ.
- We recommend to create a new VPC. And Bastion should be in the same VPC.
- Setup AWS RDS Postgresql 13.5 in the same VPC where we have the basion and automate ha node going to be created. Click [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_GettingStarted.CreatingConnecting.PostgreSQL.html) to know more.
- Setup AWS OpenSearch 1.3.6 in the same VPC where we have the basion and automate ha node going to be created. Click [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/createupdatedomains.html) to know more.
- For Backup with Managed Service we have only one option which is `Amazon S3`.
- For Backup and Restore with Managed Service. Click [here](/automate/managed_services/#enabling-opensearch-backup-restore) to know more.
- Get AWS credetials (`aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key`) which have privileges like: `AmazonS3FullAccess`, `AdministratorAccess`. Click [here](/automate/ha_iam_user/) to know more on how to create IAM Users.
- Preferred key type will be ed25519
Set the above prerequisites in `~/.aws/credentials` in Bastion Host:

  ```bash
  sudo su -
  ```

  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/.aws
  echo "[default]" >>  ~/.aws/credentials
  echo "aws_access_key_id=<ACCESS_KEY_ID>" >> ~/.aws/credentials
  echo "aws_secret_access_key=<SECRET_KEY>" >> ~/.aws/credentials
  echo "region=<AWS-REGION>" >> ~/.aws/credentials
  ```
- Have SSH Key Pair ready in AWS, so new VM's are created using that pair.\
  Reference for [AWS SSH Key Pair creation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ground-station/latest/ug/create-ec2-ssh-key-pair.html)
- We do not support passphrase for Private Key authentication.
- Make sure that bastion machine should be in the same vpc as mention in `config.toml`, otherwise we need to do [vpc peering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html).
- Use subnet-id instead of CIDR block in `config.toml`, to avoid the subnet conflict.
- Create the below attributes by following [this document.](/automate/managed_services/#enabling-opensearch-backup-restore)
  - `aws_os_snapshot_role_arn`
  - `os_snapshot_user_access_key_id`
  - `os_snapshot_user_access_key_secret`
  
  Add this to your `config.toml`
- If you choose `backup_config` as `s3` then provide the bucket name to feild `s3_bucketName`. If `s3_bucketName` exist it is directly used for backup configuration and if it doesn't exist then deployment process will create `s3_bucketName`.
- We recommended to use `backup_config` to be set to `s3` at the time of deployment.

{{< warning >}} 
- PLEASE DONOT MODIFY THE WORKSPACE PATH it should always be "/hab/a2_deploy_workspace"
- We currently don't support AD managed users in nodes. We only support local linux users.
{{< /warning >}}

### Run these steps on Bastion Host Machine

1. Run below commands to download latest Automate CLI and Airgapped Bundle:

   ```bash
   #Run commands as sudo.
   sudo -- sh -c "
   #Download Chef Automate CLI.
   curl https://packages.chef.io/files/current/latest/chef-automate-cli/chef-automate_linux_amd64.zip \
   | gunzip - > chef-automate && chmod +x chef-automate \
   | cp -f chef-automate /usr/bin/chef-automate

   #Download latest Airgapped Bundle.
   #To download specific version bundle, example version: 4.2.59 then replace latest.aib with 4.2.59.aib
   curl https://packages.chef.io/airgap_bundle/current/automate/latest.aib -o automate.aib

   #Generate init config and then generate init config for AWS infra structure
   chef-automate init-config-ha aws
   "
   ```

   {{< note >}}
   Chef Automate bundles are available for 365 days from the release of a version. However, the milestone release bundles are available for download forever.
   {{< /note >}}

1. Update Config with relevant data

   ```bash
   vi config.toml
   ```

   - Give `ssh_user` which has access to all the machines. Example: `ubuntu`.
   - Give `ssh_port` if your AMI runs on custom **ssh port**. The default value is 22.
   - Give `ssh_key_file` path, downloaded from **AWS SSH Key Pair**, which you want to use to create all the VMs. This will let you access all the VMs.
   - `sudo_password` is only meant to switch to sudo user. If you have configured password for sudo user, please provide it here.
   - We support only private key authentication.
   - Set `backup_config` to `"s3"`. If `backup_config` is `s3`, set `s3_bucketName`.
   - Set `admin_password` to access Chef Automate UI for user `admin`.
   - Don't set `fqdn` for the AWS deployment.
   - Set `instance_count` for *Chef Automate*, *Chef Infra Server*, *Postgresql*, *OpenSearch*.
   - Set AWS Config Details:
      - Set `profile`. The default value of `profile` is `"default"`.
      - Set `region`. The  default value of `region` is `"us-east-1"`.
      - Set `aws_vpc_id`, created in the Prerequisites step. Example: `"vpc12318h"`.
      - If AWS VPC uses Subnet, set `private_custom_subnets` and `public_custom_subnets`. For example : `["subnet-07e469d218301533","subnet-07e469d218041534","subnet-07e469d283041535"]`.
      - Set `ssh_key_pair_name`, an SSH Key Pair created as a Prerequisite. The pair value should be the name of the AWS SSH Key Pair without a `.pem` extension. The ssh key content should be the same as the content of `ssh_key_file`.
      - Set `setup_managed_services` as `true`, As these deployment steps are for Managed Services AWS Deployment. The default value is `false`, which should be changed.
        - Set `managed_opensearch_domain_name`, `managed_opensearch_domain_url`, `managed_opensearch_username`, `managed_opensearch_user_password` from the **Managed AWS OpenSearch** created in the Prerequisite steps.
        - Set `managed_opensearch_domain_url` as the URL without Port No. For example: `["vpc-automate-ha-cbyqy5q.eu-north-1.es.amazonaws.com"]`.
        - For backup and restore configuration set `managed_opensearch_certificate`, `aws_os_snapshot_role_arn`, `os_snapshot_user_access_key_id`, `os_snapshot_user_access_key_secret`.  [Refer this document](/automate/managed_services/#enabling-opensearch-backup-restore) to create them and get their values.
        - Set `managed_rds_instance_url` as the URL with Port No. For example: `["database-1.c2kvay.eu-north-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432"]`
        - Set `managed_rds_instance_url`, `managed_rds_superuser_username`, `managed_rds_superuser_password`, `managed_rds_dbuser_username`, `managed_rds_dbuser_password` from the **Managed AWS RDS Postgresql** created in the Prerequisite steps.
      - Set the `ami_id` value, which depends on the AWS Region and the Operating System image you want to use.
      - Use the [Hardware Requirement Calculator sheet](/calculator/automate_ha_hardware_calculator.xlsx) to get information on which instance type you will need for your load.
      - Set Instance Type for:
         - Chef Automate in `automate_server_instance_type`.
         - Chef Infra Server in `chef_server_instance_type`.
      - Set `automate_lb_certificate_arn` with the arn value of the Certificate created in AWS ACM for DNS entry of `chefautomate.example.com`.
      - Set `chef_server_lb_certificate_arn` with the arn value of the Certificate created in AWS ACM for DNS entry of `chefinfraserver.example.com`.
      - Set `automate_ebs_volume_iops`, `automate_ebs_volume_size` based on your load needs.
      - Set `chef_ebs_volume_iops`, `chef_ebs_volume_size` based on your load needs.
      - Set `automate_ebs_volume_type`, `chef_ebs_volume_type`. Default value is `"gp3"`. Change this based on your needs.

1. Continue with the deployment after updating config:

   ```bash
   #Run commands as sudo.
   sudo -- sh -c "
   #Print data in the config
   cat config.toml

   #Run provision command to deploy `automate.aib` with set `config.toml`
   chef-automate provision-infra config.toml --airgap-bundle automate.aib

   #Run deploy command to deploy `automate.aib` with set `config.toml`
   chef-automate deploy config.toml --airgap-bundle automate.aib

   #After Deployment is done successfully. Check status of Chef Automate HA services
   chef-automate status
   
   #Check Chef Automate HA deployment information, using the following command
   chef-automate info
   "
   ```

1. After the deployment successfully completed. To view the automate UI, run the command `chef-automate info`, you will get the `automate_url`.
  If we want to change the FQDN URL from the loadbalancer URL to some other FQDN URL, then use below template
  
- Create a file `a2.fqdn.toml`

  ```toml
  [global]
   [global.v1]
    fqdn = "AUTOMATE-DNS-URL-WITHOUT-HTTP"
  ```

- Run the command to apply the config from bastion

  ```toml
   chef-automate config patch a2.fqdn.toml --automate
  ```

- Create a file `cs.fqdn.toml`
  
  ```toml
  [global]
   [global.v1]
    fqdn = "AUTOMATE-DNS-URL-WITHOUT-HTTPS"
  [global.v1.external.automate]
    node = "https://AUTOMATE-DNS-URL" 
  ```

- Run the command to apply the config from the bastion

  ```toml
   chef-automate config patch cs.fqdn.toml --chef_server
  ```

{{< note >}} 
  - Have DNS certificate ready in ACM for 2 DNS entries: Example: `chefautomate.example.com`, `chefinfraserver.example.com`\
  Reference for [Creating new DNS Certificate in ACM](/automate/ha_aws_cert_mngr/).
  - DNS should have entry for `chefautomate.example.com` and `chefinfraserver.example.com` pointing to respective Load Balancers as shown in `chef-automate info` command
{{< /note >}}

Check if Chef Automate UI is accessible by going to (Domain used for Chef Automate) [https://chefautomate.example.com](https://chefautomate.example.com).

### Sample config

{{< note >}}

- Assuming 8+1 nodes (1 bastion, 1 for automate UI, 1 for Chef-server, Managed RDS Postgresql and Managed Opensearch)

{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}

- User only needs to create/setup **the bastion node**, an **user** with IAM role of Admin access, and the s3 bucket access attached to it.

- Following config will create s3 bucket for backup.

- Provide `certificate ARN` for both automate and Chef server in `automate_lb_certificate_arn` and `chef_server_lb_certificate_arn` respectively.

## Add more nodes In AWS Deployment post deployment

The commands require some arguments so that it can determine which types of nodes you want to add to your HA setup from your bastion host. It needs the count of the nodes you want to add as as argument when you run the command.
For example,

- if you want to add 2 nodes to automate, you have to run the:

    ```sh
    chef-automate node add --automate-count 2
    ```

- If you want to add 3 nodes to chef-server, you have to run the:

    ```sh
        chef-automate node add --chef-server-count 3
    ```
