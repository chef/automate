## Overview

The _Chef Infra Server_ page (**Infrastructure > Chef Servers**) lets you connect existing Chef Infra Servers to Chef Automate, view all of the connected Chef Infra Servers, and manage all of the objects on your connected Chef Infra Servers.

The _Chef Infra Server_ acts as a hub for configuration data. The Chef Infra Server stores _cookbooks_, the policies that are applied to _nodes_, and metadata that describes each registered node that is being managed by Chef Infra Client.

Nodes use Chef Infra Client to ask the Chef Infra Server for configuration details, such as recipes, templates, and file distributions. Chef Infra Client then does as much of the configuration work as possible on the nodes themselves (and not on the Chef Infra Server).

This scalable approach distributes the configuration effort throughout the organization.

{{< figure src="/images/automate/chef-server-page.png" alt="Chef Infra Server Page">}}

The objects that you can manage from the Chef Infra Server are:

- Cookbooks
- Roles
- Environments
- Data Bags
- Clients

## Connect Chef Infra Servers to Chef Automate

The _Chef Infra Server_ panel starts out with an empty list of servers.

To add existing Chef Infra Servers to the Chef Automate infrastructure, select **Add Chef Server** which will request the name, FQDN, and IP address of your Chef Infra Server:

{{< figure src="/images/automate/add-chef-server-popup-menu.png" width="500" alt="Add Chef Server Form">}}

Chef Automate will warn you if you enter an invalid FQDN or IP address:

{{< figure src="/images/automate/add-chef-server-popup-menu-with-error.png" width="500" alt="Add Chef Server Form">}}

Once you are finished, select **Add Chef Server** and you will see your server in the list of Chef Infra Servers.

## Connect a Chef Organization to a Chef Infra Server

To view a list of existing [organizations]({{< relref "server_orgs" >}}) on a Chef Infra Server,
select a Chef Infra Server from the **Chef Servers** list, then select the **Organizations** tab, as shown below:

{{< figure src="/images/automate/chef-server-organization.png" alt="Chef Infra Server Organization">}}

To create a new organization, see the documentation on [setting up a Chef Infra Server]({{< relref "infra_server#set-up-the-chef-infra-server" >}}).

To add an existing organization, select **Add Chef Organization**, which opens a dialog box as shown below:

{{< figure src="/images/automate/add-chef-organization-popup-menu.png" width="500" alt="Add Chef Organization Form">}}

Enter the _Name_, _Projects_, _Admin User_, and _Admin Key_ fields using the same values that were provided when the organization was configured using _Knife_.
Copy the contents of the `~/.chef/USER.pem` file and paste it into the **Admin Key** field. Then select **Add Chef Organization** to add the organization to the Chef Infra Server.

## Access Chef Infra Server Components

The following Chef Infra Server components for an organization can be managed using Chef Automate:

- Cookbooks
- Roles
- Environments
- Data Bags
- Clients

To access these components for an organization, select **Chef Servers > Organizations** and then select an organization. Refer to the image below:

{{< figure src="/images/automate/chef-infra-server-objects.png" alt="Chef Infra Server Objects">}}

### Cookbooks

A [cookbook]({{< relref "cookbooks" >}}) is the fundamental unit of configuration and policy distribution. A cookbook contains recipes and other files, components, or directories.

### Roles

[Roles]({{< relref "roles" >}}) let you define patterns and processes that exist across nodes in an organization as belonging to a single job function. Each role consists of zero (or more) attributes and a run-list.

The Chef Infra Server UI lets you:

### Nodes

A [node]({{< relref "/nodes" >}}) is a device that is managed by Chef Infra. During the Chef Infra Client run, the Infra Client retrieves [attributes](/nodes#attributes) that defines the expected state of the node and a [run-list](/nodes#run-lists) that defines how a node will be configured to that state from the Infra Server. The Infra Client then uses that information to update the node to its expected state.

The Chef Infra Server integration lets you:

- Search for a specific node from a list of nodes.
- View a list of all the connected nodes.
- Node details.
- Delete a node.

#### Search for a Node

Use the search bar on the Nodes tab (**Chef Infra Servers > Organizations> Nodes**)  to find a node from the list of nodes. Entering the name of a node in the search bar returns nodes matching your search criteria.

{{< figure src="/images/automate/search-a-node.png" alt="Search a Node">}}

#### Node Details

Selecting a node from the nodes list on the **Nodes** tab opens the Single Node page, which contains  **Node Information**, **Metadata**, and **Details**.  **Node Information** contains the node's `Environment`, `Policy Group` and `Policy Name`. **Metadata** contains the `Chef Server`, `Chef Organization` for that node. 


{{< figure src="/images/automate/node-information-metadata.png" alt="Node Information & Metadata">}}

The next section of the page is the details section to view or update the node environment. The drop down menu consists of the list of environment created in the chef server. You can select any one environment for the selected node.

To select the environment:

- Click on the dropdown menu and select the name of the environment.
- Selecting an environment will open a popup to save the node environment. Select **Save** to change the node environment.

{{< figure src="/images/automate/update-node-environment.png" alt="Update Node Environment">}}
- Add tags to the environment from the text bar below the dropdown menu.
**Note:** Use a comma separator to add multiple tags. Example: `Tag1`, `Tag2`, `Tag3`.



#### Delete a Node

Delete individual existing nodes by selecting the ellipses icon and then **Delete**:

{{< figure src="/images/automate/delete-a-node.png" alt="Delete a Node">}}

## Troubleshoot

While fetching any objects like cookbooks, you might face an error `Could not get cookbooks: organization 'no-org' does not exist`, which means the provided organization does not exist on Chef Infra Server.

{{< figure src="/images/automate/could-not-get-cookbooks-organization.png" alt="Could not get cookbooks: Organization">}}

Create the organization using the knife command, `knife opc org create` or the Chef Infra Server CLI command, `chef-server-ctl org-create`, then add the _Name_, _Projects_, _Admin User_, and _Admin Key_ to fetch the objects.
