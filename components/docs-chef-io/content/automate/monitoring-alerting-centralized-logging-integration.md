The Chef Automate HA equates to reliability, efficiency, and productivity which is built on Highly-Available Infrastructure. However, it lacks in providing visibility into health of Chef-Automate HA infrastructure, its components and its services.​ By integrating Monitoring, Alerting, and Centralized logging tools with Chef Automate HA, one can get the visibility into various Chef-Automate HA components' health.​

Chef Suite is a set of solutions that most organizations trust to deliver their infrastructure management, automation, compliance, and remediation needs. Given the critical nature of these capabilities, organizations often implement high availability (HA) measures to guarantee the constant accessibility of the systems supporting the Chef solution.

The integration comes with:

- High uptime of critical Chef Automate HA infrastructure to maintain system stability.​

- Monitoring of Automate HA services​.

- Providing advance notification for potential failures.​

- Enabling dashboard and reporting capabilities for Chef-Automate HA cluster.​

The integration and monitoring has taken place using several which you can find in following explained documentation:

- [ELK Installation and Configuration](https://github.com/chef/monitoring-integration-automate/tree/main/ELK)

- [AWS CloudWatch](https://github.com/chef/monitoring-integration-automate/tree/main/cloud-watch)

- [DataDog Integration](https://github.com/chef/monitoring-integration-automate/tree/main/data-dog)

- [Prometheus](https://github.com/chef/monitoring-integration-automate/tree/main/prometheus)

The integration with different tools has been explained in the following blogs. You can refer to them for detailed integration process:
