This page explains the procedure to migrate the existing Chef infrastructure data to the newly deployed Chef Automate HA. This migration involves two steps:

-   Back up the data from an existing network infrastructure (chef-server) that has Chef Automate installed.
-   Restore the backed-up data to the newly deployed Chef Automate HA environment (chef-server).

There can be two possible scenarios:

-   Migrating from standalone Chef Server to Chef Automate Chef Server, part of a2-ha-backend frontend nodes cluster.

-   Migrating from Chef Backend cluster to Chef Automate Chef Server, part of a2-ha-backend frontend nodes cluster

Take backup using the _knife-ec-backup_ utility and move the backup folder to the newly deployed Chef Server. Later, restore using the same utility. The backup migrates all the cookbooks, users, data-bags, policies, and organizations.

`knife-ec-backup` utility backups and restores the data in an Enterprise Chef Server installation, preserving the data in an intermediate, editable text format. It is similar to the knife download and knife upload commands and uses the same underlying libraries. It includes workarounds for unsupported objects by the tools and various Server API deficiencies. The goal is to improve knife download, knife upload, and the Chef Infra Server API to deprecate the tool.

{{< note >}} The migration procedure is tested on Chef Server version 14+. {{< /note >}}

## Backup the Existing Chef Server Data

-   Execute the `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/habitat-sh/habitat/master/components/hab/install.sh \ | sudo bash` command to install Habitat.

-   Execute the `hab pkg install chef/knife-ec-backup` command to install the habitat package for _knife-ec-backup_.

-   Execute the `hab pkg exec chef/knife-ec-backup knife tidy server report --node-threshold 60 -s <chef server URL> -u <pivotal> -k <path of pivotal>` command to generate a knife tidy server report to examine the stale nodes and new cookbooks. In this command:
    -   `pivotal` is the name of the user
    -   `path of pivotal` is the path where the user's pem file is stored.
    -   `node-threshold NUM_DAYS` is the maximum number of days since the last checking before a node is considered stale.

For example, `hab pkg exec chef/knife-ec-backup knife tidy server report --node-threshold 60 -s https://chef.io -u pivotal -k /etc/opscode/pivotal.pem`.

-   Execute the `hab pkg exec chef/knife-ec-backup knife ec backup backup_$(date '+%Y%m%d%H%M%s') --webui-key /etc/opscode/webui_priv.pem -s <chef server URL>` command to initiate a backup of your Chef Server data. In this command:
    -   `with-user-sql` is required to handle user passwords and ensure user-specific association groups that are not duplicate.
    -   `--with-key-sql` is to handle cases where customers have users with multiple pem keys associated with their user or clients. The current chef-server API only dumps the default key. Sometimes, users will generate and assign additional keys to give additional users access to an account but still be able to lock them out later without removing everyone's access.

For example, `hab pkg exec chef/knife-ec-backup knife ec backup backup_$(date '+%Y%m%d%H%M%s') --webui-key /etc/opscode/webui_priv.pem -s https://chef.io`.

-   Execute the `hab pkg exec chef/knife-ec-backup knife tidy server clean --backup-path /path/to/an-ec-backup` command to clean unused data from reports. _Optional_

-   Execute the `scp -i /path/to/key backup\_$(date '+%Y%m%d%H%M%s') user@host:/home/user` command to copy the backup directory to the Chef Server frontend.

## Restore Backed Up Data to Chef Automate HA

-   Execute the `hab pkg install chef/knife-ec-backup` command to install the habitat package for _knife-ec-backup_.

-   Execute the `hab pkg exec chef/knife-ec-backup knife ec restore /home/centos/backup\_2021061013191623331154 -yes --concurrency 1 --webui-key /hab/svc/automate-cs-oc-erchef/data/webui\_priv.pem --purge -c /hab/pkgs/chef/chef-server-ctl/*/*/omnibus-ctl/spec/fixtures/pivotal.rb` command to restore the backup.
