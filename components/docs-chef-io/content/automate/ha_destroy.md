To destroy **terraform** or **infrastructure** created while deploying **Chef Automate High Availability (HA)** using AWS or on-premises model, follow the steps below:

- If the `provision-infra` command fails, execute the following command to clear the space utilized by this command before it fails:

`for i in 1;do i=$PWD;cd /hab/a2_deploy_workspace/terraform/;terraform destroy -state=/hab/a2_deploy_workspace/terraform/destroy/aws/terraform.tfstate;cd $i;done`

- If the `provision-infra` command ran successfully and if you want to clear the space utilized by this command, execute these commands in the ordered list:

1. `for i in 1;do i=$PWD;cd /hab/a2_deploy_workspace/terraform/destroy/aws/;terraform init;cd $i;done`.

1. `for i in 1;do i=$PWD;cd /hab/a2_deploy_workspace/terraform/destroy/aws/;terraform destroy;cd $i;done`.

- If you have deployed the Chef Automate HA successfully and wanted to destroy the deployment part alone, execute the following command:

`for i in 1;do i=$PWD;cd /hab/a2_deploy_workspace/terraform/;terraform destroy;cd $i;done`

{{< note >}}
The deployment destroy does not remove any remote server configuration made; however, it retains the terraform, and thus you need to redo the configurations.

- If you have deployed the Chef Automate HA successfully and wanted to destroy the entire infrastructure instances, execute the following commands:

`for i in 1;do i=$PWD;cd /hab/a2_deploy_workspace/terraform/destroy/aws/;terraform init;cd $i;done`.

`for i in 1;do i=$PWD;cd /hab/a2_deploy_workspace/terraform/destroy/aws/;terraform destroy;cd $i;done`.
