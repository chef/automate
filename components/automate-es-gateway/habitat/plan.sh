# TODO(ssd) 2018-07-27: This instance of nginx should not have to run
# as root. This is here so that we can reliably send access logs to
# stdout. Nginx does not natively have an option to send access logs
# to stdout. To get around this, we use /dev/stdout. Unfortunately,
# because of how we are started by hab, both /dev/stdout and
# /proc/self/fd/1 both eventually point to files that are owned by
# root. We could potentially get around this with some named pipes and
# `tail -f`, but since the nginx worker threads will drop priv's to
# the `hab` user I've opted to set our svc_user as root, in line with
# the other nginx instances in A2 at the moment:
