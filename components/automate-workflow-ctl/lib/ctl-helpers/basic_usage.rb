module CtlHelpers
  # Very basic usage parser for omnibus-ctl commands.
  # Written to address several delivery-ctl commands that didn't respond to --help.
  #
  # When using with omnibus-ctl, should remove leading args before passing in ARGV.
  # For example, your command "my-command" should receive ARGV like:
  #   ARGV: [my-command some args]
  # But you should simply pass:
  #   args: [some args]
  # So, you probably wanna initialize this class like:
  #   CtlHelpers::BasicUsage.new(ARGV[1..-1], "my-command", "Optional description.")
