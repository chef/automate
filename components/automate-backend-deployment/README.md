# Automate::Backend::Deployment

This provides the `automate-backend-deployment` package.

This package will build a package using terraform/a2ha-terraform, inspecs, test, certs and Makefile. 

This is the heart of the a2ha because this component will set up a workspace for a2ha and all the a2ha command will get avilable after installing this package.
