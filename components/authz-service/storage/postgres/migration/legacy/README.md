# Legacy IAM V2 Migration

All the code in this folder is copied legacy migration code to upgrade all installs to IAM V2.
All code assumes a specific schema at a single point in the migration path.

UNLESS MIGRATIONS START FAILING, THIS CODE SHOULD NEVER NEED TO BE MODIFIED. TREAT THIS CODE LIKE A MIGRATION.
