    # Inactivity timeout for bi-directional communication. This is the
    # how long a long-lived connection is allowed to stayl idle.  We
    # likely want to keep this high to avoid unnecessarily killing
    # long-lived SQL connections used by low-request-rate services.
    timeout tunnel {{cfg.timeouts.idle}}s
    # Client inactivity connections for half-closed connections (i.e
    # the server has closed the connection and but the client has
    # not). The HAProxy documentation recommends setting this whenever
    # `timeout tunnel` is also set.

    # NOTE(ssd) 2019-07-10: The HAProxy documentation says that this
    # setting should not be needed; however, we have observed that
    # when a postgresql client disconnects uncleanly, HAProxy does not
    # immediately close the backend until the connection times out. If
    # a service is failing in a loop, this can quickly lead to the
    # exhaustion of available ports.
    timeout server-fin 1s
    # Client and server inactivity timeouts. Per the HAProxy
    # documentation, the tunnel timeout above superceeds these once
    # bidirection communication is established.
