  Examines an inbound notification and determines if it should be forwarded
  on to the next stage of processing.  Runs a pipeline of filters that
  stops at first failed condition, and otherwise runs all the way through.

  Currently the following are checked:
   - is it a critical control failure (if compliance failure)
   - have we already processed this notification in another request?
   - do we have a formatter for this notification type?
