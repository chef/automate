This information can be useful to developers who are developing software for a particular OS platform. If mingetty(8) supports the following options, they display operating system information:\n\n\\m - machine architecture (uname -m)\n\\r - operating system release (uname -r)\n\\s - operating system name\n\\v - operating system version (uname -v)\n\nRationale: Displaying OS and patch level information in login banners also has the side effect of providing detailed system information to attackers attempting to target specific exploits of a system.
