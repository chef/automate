    # Authentication
    The standard way of authenticating for the Automate API is to generate an
    API token and pass that with your API requests with the `api-token` header.
    An example request using curl looks like this:

    ```
    curl -s -H "api-token: $TOKEN" https://automate.example.com/api/v0/auth/policies -v
    ```

    For more information about authentication, refer to the
    [API Tokens](https://automate.chef.io/docs/api-tokens/)
    section of the Automate documentation.
