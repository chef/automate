synopsis: Remove services from the applications database

description: |2

  Remove services from the applications database.

  You must fully decommission services by retiring physical hardware, terminating
  the VM or container, or by using 'hab svc unload', before using the
  'remove-svcs' command. Services that are incompletely decommissioned will send
  a health-check at the appointed time and Automate will re-add them to the
  services database.
