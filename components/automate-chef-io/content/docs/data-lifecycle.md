# Overview

Data Lifecycle manages the retention of events, service groups, Chef Client runs, compliance reports and scans in Chef Automate.
Chef Automate stores data from the `ingest-service`, `event-feed-service`,
`compliance-service` and `applications-service` in ElasticSearch or PostgreSQL.
Over time users may wish to prune data from Chef Automate by creating data
lifecycle policies.

The `data-lifecycle` API allows configuring and running lifecycle jobs by data type:

* `infra` Chef Infra Server actions and Chef Client converge data
* `compliance` Chef Inspec reports and Chef Compliance scans
* `event-feed` Event metadata that powers the operational visibility and query language

Different jobs are available depending on the data type you wish to configure or run.

In order to see the data lifecycle job statuses, configure jobs, or run jobs, you will need
an [admin token]({{< relref "api-tokens.md#creating-an-admin-api-token" >}}) or a token
for a user with `dataLifecycle:*` IAM access.

## Status

To see the combined status and configuration for all data lifecycle jobs you can use the global status endpoint
```bash
curl -s -H "api-token: $TOKEN" https://{{< example_fqdn "automate" >}}/api/v0/data-lifecycle/status
```

To see individual statuses by data type you can access the data type sub-status endpoints:

```bash
curl -s -H "api-token: $TOKEN" https://{{< example_fqdn "automate" >}}/api/v0/data-lifecycle/event-feed/status
```

Swap `event-feed` for `infra` or `compliance` to see their corresponding jobs.

The status in an aggregate of the job configuration, details about it's next scheduled run, and details about
any previous runs.

## Configuration

Configure the data lifecycle job settings by creating a JSON file with the desired configuration.

```json
{ "infra": {
    "job_settings": [
      { "name":"delete_nodes",
        "disabled": true,
        "recurrence": "FREQ=MINUTELY;DTSTART=20191106T180240Z;INTERVAL=15",
        "threshold": "365d"
      },
      { "name":"missing_nodes",
        "disabled": false,
        "recurrence": "FREQ=MINUTELY;DTSTART=20191106T180240Z;INTERVAL=15",
        "threshold": "1d"
      },
      { "name":"missing_nodes_for_deletion",
        "disabled": false,
        "recurrence": "FREQ=MINUTELY;DTSTART=20191106T180240Z;INTERVAL=15",
        "threshold": "30d"
      },
      { "name":"periodic_purge_timeseries",
        "disabled": false,
        "recurrence": "FREQ=DAILY;DTSTART=20191106T180240Z;INTERVAL=1",
        "purge_policies": {
          "elasticsearch": [
            {
              "policy_name": "actions",
              "older_than_days": 30,
              "disabled": false
            },
            {
              "policy_name": "converge-history",
              "older_than_days": 30,
              "disabled": false
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "compliance": {
    "job_settings": [
      {
        "name": "periodic_purge",
        "disabled": false,
        "recurrence": "FREQ=DAILY;DTSTART=20191106T180323Z;INTERVAL=1",
        "purge_policies": {
          "elasticsearch": [
            {
              "policy_name": "compliance-reports",
              "older_than_days": 100,
              "disabled": false
            },
            {
              "policy_name": "compliance-scans",
              "older_than_days": 100,
              "disabled": false
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "event_feed": {
    "job_settings": [
      {
        "name": "periodic_purge",
        "disabled": false,
        "recurrence": "FREQ=DAILY;DTSTART=20191106T180243Z;INTERVAL=2",
        "purge_policies": {
          "elasticsearch": [
            {
              "policy_name": "feed",
              "older_than_days": 90,
              "disabled": false
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Configure the jobs by sending the JSON payload to the `configure` endpoint. Save the JSON file as `config.json`
in the current working directory.
```bash
curl -s -H "api-token: $TOKEN" -X PUT --data "@config.json" https://{{< example_fqdn "automate" >}}/api/v0/data-lifecycle/config
```

If you wish to configure a specific endpoint only, you can specify the `job_settings` for that
data type and configure it using data types sub-resource. For example, if you want to configure
compliance settings create a smaller JSON payload:

```json
{ "job_settings": [
    {
      "name": "periodic_purge",
      "disabled": false,
      "recurrence": "FREQ=DAILY;DTSTART=20191106T180323Z;INTERVAL=1",
      "purge_policies": {
        "elasticsearch": [
          {
            "policy_name": "compliance-reports",
            "older_than_days": 100,
            "disabled": false
          },
          {
            "policy_name": "compliance-scans",
            "older_than_days": 100,
            "disabled": false
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

And update it using the `compliance` sub-resource
```bash
curl -s -H "api-token: $TOKEN" -X PUT --data "@config.json" https://{{< example_fqdn "automate" >}}/api/v0/data-lifecycle/compliance/config
```

### Job Settings

All jobs have the following options:

* `recurrence` (string) A recurrence rule that determines how often, at what interval, and when to initially start a scheduled
  job. Any valid recurrence rule [as defined in section 4.3.10 of RFC 2445](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt) is valid in this field.
* `disabled` (bool) Whether or not this job should be enabled

Infra node lifecycle jobs have the following options:

* `threshold` (string) setting that allows the user to use `1w` style notation to denote how long before the infra job is trigged.

Purge jobs have the following options:

* `purge_polices` (map) configures how old the corresponding data must be in the configured storage backend before it is purged.
  * `elasticsearch` (array) an array of ElasticSearch purge policies
    * `disabled` (bool) Whether or not this job should be enabled
    * `policy_name` (string) The name of the purge policy you wish to update
    * `older_than_days` (int) The name of the purge policy you wish to update

#### Infra Job Settings

The `infra` data type has four data lifecycle jobs, three are for node lifecycle and one is purge job with two ElasticSearch purge policies.

```json
{ "job_settings": [
    { "name":"delete_nodes",
      "disabled": true,
      "recurrence": "FREQ=MINUTELY;DTSTART=20191106T180240Z;INTERVAL=15",

          "older_than_days": 30,
          "disabled": false
        }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

* `delete_nodes` how long a node can exist before it is deleted.
* `missing_nodes` how long between a node's last check-in before it
  is marked as missing.
* `missing_nodes_for_deletion` how long a node can be missing before it is deleted
* `periodic_purge_timeseries` how often to run the purge job
  * `actions` Chef Infra Server actions
  * `converge-history` Chef Infra Client converge data

#### Compliance Job Settings

The `compliance` data type has one compliance purge job with two ElasticSearch purge policies.

```json
{ "job_settings": [
    {
      "name": "periodic_purge",
      "disabled": false,
      "recurrence": "FREQ=DAILY;DTSTART=20191106T180323Z;INTERVAL=1",
      "purge_policies": {
        "elasticsearch": [
          {
            "policy_name": "compliance-reports",
            "older_than_days": 100,
            "disabled": false
          },
          {
            "policy_name": "compliance-scans",
            "older_than_days": 100,
            "disabled": false
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

* `periodic_purge` how often to run the purge job
  * `compliance-reports` Chef Inspec reports
  * `compliance-scans` Chef Compliance scans

#### Event Feed Job Settings

The `event_feed` data type has one event feed purge job with one ElasticSearch purge policy.

```json
{ "job_settings": [
    { "name": "periodic_purge",
      "disabled": false,
      "recurrence": "FREQ=DAILY;DTSTART=20191106T180243Z;INTERVAL=2",
      "purge_policies": {
        "elasticsearch": [
        {
          "policy_name": "feed",
          "older_than_days": 90,
          "disabled": false
        }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

* `periodic_purge` how often to run the purge job
  * `feed` Queryable event feed

## Run

As with `status` and `configure`, you can run data lifecycle jobs globally across all data or by using the data type sub-resource.

To run all data lifecycle jobs immediately run the following command:

```bash
curl -s -H "api-token: $TOKEN" -X POST https://{{< example_fqdn "automate" >}}/api/v0/data-lifecycle/run
```

To only run jobs for a specific data type you can make the request to the sub-resource:

```bash
curl -s -H "api-token: $TOKEN" -X POST https://{{< example_fqdn "automate" >}}/api/v0/data-lifecycle/infra/run
```

Swap `infra` for `event-feed` or `compliance` to run their corresponding jobs.
