## Overview

Chef Automate supports three different types of users: local users, [LDAP users]({{< relref "ldap.md" >}}), and [SAML users]({{< relref "saml.md" >}}). Manage local users from the **Settings** tab.

Local users can sign in and interact with the system independent of LDAP or SAML.

Permission for the `iam:users` action is required to interact with users other than yourself. Any user that is part of the `admins` team or the `Administrator` policy will have this permission. Otherwise, [IAM custom policies]({{< relref "iam-v2-guide.md#creating-custom-policies" >}}) can be created to assign this permission.

## Managing Local Users

### Creating Local Users

Navigate to _Users_ in the **Settings** tab. Select the **Create User** button, which opens a dialog box for entering the user's _display name_, and _password_. A username automatically generates upon creation. If you would like to change the username, use the **Edit Username** button.

### Changing Display Names

Navigate to _Users_ in the **Settings** tab and locate the user who needs their display name changed. Navigate to their user page, provide a new display name, and select the **Save** button.

All local users can also change their own display names from the _Profile_ menu.

### Resetting Passwords

Navigate to _Users_ in the **Settings** tab and locate the user who needs a password reset. Navigate to their user page, and then the **Reset Password** tab. Provide a new password, confirm the new password, and then select the **Reset Password** button.

All local users can also reset their own passwords from the _Profile_ menu.

### Deleting Local Users

Navigate to _Users_ in the **Settings** tab. Then open the menu at the end of the table row and select **Delete User**.

## User Self-Maintenance

Local Automate users can manage their own display name and password.
Select the user icon in the top navigation bar, and then select **Profile** from the drop-down menu.
