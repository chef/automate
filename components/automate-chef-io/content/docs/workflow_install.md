Workflow is a legacy feature for Chef Automate, which was designed for managing changes to both infrastructure and application code.

{{< warning >}}
Workflow is only available in Chef Automate for existing users. If you are not already using Workflow, but are interested in the solution it offers, please contact your sales or success representative for support with continuous integration pipelines.
{{< /warning >}}

## Prerequisites

Create a system which is accessible from your Automate 2.0 environment via SSH.
This will have a minimum of three machines:

* Automate With Workflow - 8GB RAM recommended
* Chef Infra Server - 8GB RAM recommended
* Workflow Runner - 20GB disk space recommended

## Backup

1. Backup your Chef Automate 1 install, to minimize the amount of data that will need to be backed up while the system is down:

    ```shell
    automate-ctl create-backup
    ```

## Upgrading

{{< warning >}}
Migration of Workflow data must happen during your upgrade to Chef Automate 2.
{{< /warning >}}

1. Deploy the Workflow server:

    ```shell
    chef-automate upgrade-from-v1 --enable-workflow
    ```

    After the upgrade runs the preflight checks and analyzes your Chef Automate 1 configuration, it asks for confirmation to continue. Review the generated configuration file and if it is correct, type `yes` to continue.

    The upgrade process backs up your Chef Automate 1 data, shuts down Chef Automate 1, imports your data to Chef Automate 2, then starts Chef Automate 2.
    At this point, you can use your existing Chef Automate 1 user credentials to login to Chef Automate 2.
    If you've been using LDAP for authenticating users, that configuration will have been migrated as well, and you can use your LDAP credentials to login.
    Historical data will be migrated in the background.

2. Create a workflow enterprise:

    ```text
    automate-ctl create-enterprise my-enterprise-name --ssh-pub-key-file=/hab/svc/automate-workflow-server/var/etc/builder_key.pub
    ```

### Build a Standalone Chef Infra Server

Create a standalone Chef Infra Server following the [standalone server installation](https://docs.chef.io/install_server/#standalone).

Then, on the Chef Infra Server:

1. Create a 'workflow' user on the Chef Infra Server:

    ```shell
    sudo chef-server-ctl user-create workflow workflow user ops@some.domain.com workflow
    ```

2. Creating a user in previous step displays a private key to stdout. Copy this content and and save it on the **Chef Automate** server as: `/hab/svc/automate-workflow-server/var/etc/delivery.pem`

3. If this is a new Chef Infra Server, create an organization on the Chef Infra Server with:

    ```shell
    `sudo chef-server-ctl org-create workflow workflow
    ```

4. Add the 'workflow' user as an admin to the Chef Infra Server organization that you created when setting up your Chef Infra Server:

    ```shell
    sudo chef-server-ctl org-user-add my-chef-org workflow --admin
    ```

### Configure the Chef Automate Server

1. Set up your Chef Automate server to communicate with your Chef Infra Server by creating a `workflow.toml`:

    ```toml
    [workflow.v1.sys.chef_server]
    url = "https://my.chef.server.com/organizations/my-chef-organization"
    web_ui_url = "https://my.chef.server.com/"
    chef_user = "workflow"
    ```

    The FQDN saved in the `workflow.toml` on the Chef Automate Server must match the FQDN of the Chef Infra Server (find it by entering `hostname --fqdn` into your Chef Infra Server terminal) or you will have SSL certificate failures later in this process.

    For example, if running `hostname --fqdn` from your Automate server command line returns `automate-test`, then that hostname will need to be in the local dns configuration on your workstation.

    For example, `/etc/hosts` would contain a line like:

    ```text
      192.168.0.20    automate-test
    ```

1. Apply the configuration:

    ```shell
    chef-automate config patch workflow.toml
    ```

### Login to the Web UI

1. Navigate to `https://automate-test` on your workstation
2. Login as _admin_, using the password from the  `automate-credentials.toml` file that was created on your Automate server with `chef-automate deploy`

## Workflow

Access Workflow by opening the _Client Runs_ tab and then selecting **Workflow** on the left navigation panel.

Selecting **Workflow** opens the legacy Workflow screen.

### Create an Organization

1. From the Workflow UI, select **Workflow Orgs** on the left
1. Select **New Workflow Org**
1. Enter an organization name, for example, "testing", and select **Save & Close**

![](/images/docs/workflow-org.png)

### Set a Workflow Admin SSH Key

1. From the Workflow UI, select the _Admin_ tab on top
1. Select the **edit** button for the admin user
1. Enter a first and last name, and an email address
1. Paste your ssh public key into the **SSH KEY** field
1. Select **Save & Close**

![](/images/docs/workflow-ssh.png)

### Configure Runners

#### On the Runner

1. Create another VM that is also accessible from your Automate 2.0 environment.
2. Create a new user on the VM, for example, "workflow"

    ```shell
      sudo useradd workflow -G sudo --create-home
    ```

3. Let new user to use sudo without entering a password, by putting the new user into the `sudo` group and ensuring this line exists at the end of `/etc/sudoers`

    ```shell
    %sudo  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
    ```

4. Copy the SSH public key from the `/hab/svc/automate-workflow-server/var/etc/builder_key.pub` file that was made during the enterprise creation step on the Automate server to the `/home/workflow/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the new VM.
5. Confirm the hostname and IP addresses of the Chef Automate server and the Chef Infra Servers in `/etc/hosts`

    For example, `/etc/hosts` would contain lines like:

    ```text
      192.168.0.20    automate-test
      192.168.1.100   chef-infra-server
    ```

#### On the Automate 2 server

1. From the command line, run:

    ```text
    workflow-ctl install-runner my.vm.hostname.or.ip.address workflow -i /hab/svc/automate-workflow-server/var/etc/builder_key
    ```

2. Open Automate in a web browser, then select the _Client Runs_ tab, and finally, select Workflow on the menu on the left.
3. Select **Runners** from the navbar
4. Select **Manage Runners** from the page
5. You should see your newly installed runner, select the **TEST** button

### Creating a Pipeline

1. Download the latest stable release [ChefDK](https://downloads.chef.io/chefdk).
2. Create a new directory, for example, `delivery-test`, and move into that directory:

    ```shell
    mkdir delivery-test
    cd delivery-test
    ```

3. Initialize the repository with:

    ```shell
    git init
    ```

4. Setup the pipeline, using values from your own system:

    ```shell
    delivery setup --ent=demo --org=testing --user=admin --server=automate-test --a2-mode
    ```

    1. Replace "demo" with the name created in `workflow-ctl create-enterprise`
    1. Replace "testing" with the name of the organization you created in Workflow
    1. The user should remain _admin_

5. Confirm that you're logged into the Workflow UI in your web browser
6. Run `delivery init --a2-mode`
7. It will prompt for a token and open your web browser. Select copy on the page that displays the token.
Return to your shell and paste the token.

## Troubleshooting

### workflow-ctl

For clarity, we renamed `automate-ctl` command `workflow-ctl`. Resolve the following error message:

```text
deployment-service.default(O):time="2018-12-10T21:30:03Z"
level=error msg="Converge failed" error="failed to binlink
command "automate-ctl" in pkg "chef/automate-workflow-ser
ver/2.8.31 20181207185527" into /bin\nxxx\nxxx
'automate-ctl' was not found under any 'PATH' directories
in the chef automate-workflow-server/2.8.31/20181207185527
package\nxxx\n: exit status 1"
```

by making a manual binlink to the new `workflow-ctl` binary with:

`$ hab pkg binlink chef/automate-workflow-server workflow-ctl -f`

### Public Key Error

If `delivery init --a2-mode` results in:

```text

```

You may need to add the private key associated with the ssh public key for the Workflow admin in the UI:

```shell
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/<ssh private key>
```

### Known Issues

* Authentication times out after three minutes if you don't keep a browser window open on Chef Automate.
