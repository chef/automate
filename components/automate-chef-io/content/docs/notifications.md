## About Notifications

Chef Automate notifications uses webhooks to send alerts for failures of Chef Infra Client runs and InSpec compliance scans. You can send notifications to Slack channels, Slack users, or any other service that supports webhook integrations. Notifications are sent for all failures. To ignore a failure, set the `ignore_failure` attribute to `true` on the resource. 

By default only Admins of Chef Automate may create and manage notifications.

{{< warning >}}
Notifications sent by Chef Automate do not support retries; therefore, notifications sent while Slack or the external service receiving the notification is experiencing API issues, outages, or some other unplanned downtime may never be received. Undelivered notifications are not re-sent. Attempts to send notifications do generate log messages in your Chef Automate server.
