## Alpha: Setting up Automate as an OAuth Provider for Habitat Builder

{{% warning %}}
Authentication via Automate for Habitat Builder is still in Alpha.
{{% /warning %}}

To configure Chef Automate as an OAuth Provider for Habitat Builder, create a TOML file
that contains the partial configuration below.
Run `chef-automate config patch </path/to/your-file.toml>` to deploy your change.

`bldr_client_id` and `bldr_client_secret` simply need to match what you configured for the corresponding
values in Habitat Builder (see below). However, we strongly recommend those values follow
[best practices](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/client-registration/client-id-secret/)
for `client_id` and `client_secret` in the Oauth2 standard.

```toml
[session.v1.sys.service]
bldr_signin_url = "<your Builder fqdn>" # for example, "http://builder.test/"

# This needs to match what you configured OAUTH_CLIENT_ID as when you configured Habitat Builder.
bldr_client_id = "<your Habitat Builder Oauth2 Client ID>"

# This needs to match what you configured OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET as when you configured Habitat Builder.
bldr_client_secret = "<your Habitat Builder Oauth2 Client Secret>"
```

You'll need to add Automate's TLS certificate to Builder's list of accepted certificates
in addition to these configuration changes.
Locate Automate's default self-signed certificate by running `cat /hab/svc/automate-load-balancer/data/{{< example_fqdn "automate" >}}.cert`
You can copy this default certificate, and then add it to your Builder instance's list of accepted certs.

```text
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIDfDCCAmSgAcasldkaf...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

If you are using a certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority instead of the default certificate,
you can provide Builder with the root certificate authority for the signed certificate.
